How do you usually spend your weekends? [Why?]</p> <p>Well, it depends on the circumstances. If the weather permits, I will go jogging or hang out with friends. In contrast, if the weather is bad, I prefer to stay indoors and read novels. I enjoy doing what I feel like doing and not being restricted by errands.</p> <p>#### 2. Which is your favorite part of the weekend? [Why?]</p> <p>I love Friday evenings when everyone is laid back, because the entire weekend is waiting ahead. On Friday evenings, I usually eat out with friends and then stay up for a movie or a TV show, knowing that I'll be able to sleep in the next morning.</p> <p>#### 3. Do you think your weekends are long enough? [Why/Why not?]</p> <p>No, I wish I had more spare time to entertain myself and loosen up after a whole week's toil. If I had longer weekends, I would be able to exercise on a weekly basis. I might take up swimming and cycling or join the gym to work out.</p> <p>#### 4. How important do you think it is to have free time at the weekends? [Why?]</p> <p>It is absolutely essential. First of all, I can spend some quality time with my family. In addition, a good weekend can help me unwind mentally and physically. I'm usually more efficient and productive in the following week if I've had enough quality sleep on the weekend. I guess it's probably because our brains need rests in order to memorize and process things better.</p>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_10/#advanced-vocabulary-and-phrases","title":"Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases","text":"<ul> <li>it depends /\u026at d\u026a\u02c8p\u025bndz/: \u89c6\u60c5\u51b5\u800c\u5b9a</li> <li>if the weather permits /\u026af \u00f0\u0259 \u02c8w\u025b\u00f0\u0259r p\u0259r\u02c8m\u026ats/: \u5982\u679c\u5929\u6c14\u5141\u8bb8</li> <li>hang out with friends /h\u00e6\u014b a\u028at w\u026a\u00f0 fr\u025bndz/: \u548c\u670b\u53cb\u4e00\u8d77\u6d88\u78e8\u65f6\u95f4</li> <li>if the weather is bad /\u026af \u00f0\u0259 \u02c8w\u025b\u00f0\u0259r \u026az b\u00e6d/: \u5982\u679c\u5929\u6c14\u4e0d\u597d</li> <li>restricted by errands /r\u026a\u02c8str\u026akt\u026ad ba\u026a \u02c8\u025br\u0259ndz/: \u53d7\u5dee\u4f7f\u7684\u9650\u5236</li> <li>laid back /le\u026ad b\u00e6k/: \u653e\u677e\u7684\uff0c\u60a0\u95f2\u7684</li> <li>waiting ahead /\u02c8we\u026at\u026a\u014b \u0259\u02c8h\u025bd/: \u671f\u5f85\u7740\u672a\u6765\u7684\u65f6\u95f4</li> <li>eat out /i\u02d0t a\u028at/: \u51fa\u53bb\u5403\u996d</li> <li>stay up /ste\u026a \u028cp/: \u71ac\u591c</li> <li>sleep in /sli\u02d0p \u026an/: \u7761\u61d2\u89c9</li> <li>entertain myself /\u02cc\u025bnt\u0259r\u02c8te\u026an ma\u026a\u02c8s\u025blf/: \u5a31\u4e50\u81ea\u5df1\uff0c\u6d88\u9063</li> <li>loosen up /\u02cclu\u02d0s\u0259n \u028cp/: \u653e\u677e\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u538b\u529b</li> <li>toil /t\u0254\u026al/: \u8f9b\u52e4\u5de5\u4f5c</li> <li>if I had longer weekends /\u026af a\u026a h\u00e6d \u02c8l\u0254\u014b\u0261\u0259r \u02c8wi\u02d0k\u025bndz/: \u5982\u679c\u6211\u6709\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u5468\u672b</li> <li>exercise on a weekly basis /\u02c8\u025bks\u0259rsa\u026az \u0251n \u0259 \u02c8wikli \u02c8be\u026as\u026as/: \u6bcf\u5468\u953b\u70bc</li> <li>take up swimming and cycling /te\u026ak \u028cp \u02c8sw\u026am\u026a\u014b \u00e6nd \u02c8sa\u026akl\u026a\u014b/: \u5f00\u59cb\u6e38\u6cf3\u548c\u9a91\u81ea\u884c\u8f66</li> <li>join the gym /d\u0292\u0254\u026an \u00f0\u0259 d\u0292\u026am/: \u52a0\u5165\u5065\u8eab\u623f</li> <li>work out /w\u025crk a\u028at/: \u953b\u70bc\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4f53\u80b2\u6d3b\u52a8</li> <li>it is absolutely essential /\u026at \u026az \u02c8\u00e6bs\u0259lu\u02d0tli \u026a\u02c8s\u025bn\u0283\u0259l/: \u8fd9\u662f\u7edd\u5bf9\u5fc5\u8981\u7684</li> <li>quality time /\u02c8kw\u0251l\u0259ti ta\u026am/: \u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u6307\u4e0e\u5bb6\u4eba\u5171\u5ea6\u7684\u6109\u5feb\u65f6\u5149\uff09</li> <li>unwind mentally and physically /\u02cc\u028cn\u02c8wa\u026and \u02c8m\u025bnt\u0259li \u00e6nd \u02c8f\u026az\u026akli/: \u8eab\u5fc3\u653e\u677e</li> <li>more efficient and productive /m\u0254r \u026a\u02c8f\u026a\u0283\u0259nt \u00e6nd pr\u0259\u02c8d\u028ckt\u026av/: \u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u6709\u751f\u4ea7\u529b</li> <li>quality sleep /\u02c8kw\u0251l\u0259ti sli\u02d0p/: \u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7761\u7720</li> <li>rests /r\u025bsts/: \u4f11\u606f\u65f6\u95f4</li> <li>memorize and process /\u02c8m\u025bm\u0259r\u028c\u026az \u00e6nd \u02c8pr\u0251s\u025bs/: \u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u5904\u7406</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_10/#part2","title":"part2","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_10/#ielts-speaking-preparation-describe-someone-you-know-who-does-something-well","title":"IELTS Speaking Preparation: Describe Someone You Know Who Does Something Well","text":"<p>Describe someone you know who does something well.</p> <p>You should say:</p> <ul> <li>who this person is</li> <li>how you know this person</li> <li>what they do well</li> <li>and explain why you think this person is so good at doing this.</li> </ul> <p>The person I'm going to tell you about is someone I've admired for a long time.

He covered a lot of knowledge points during class, not only language and linguistics, but also history, culture, and arts.

Next to the counter, there are big containers of candies and nuts.

And when they come back home, they would be too tired to spend much time with their kids.

They have learned to respect their children's own choices and only offer advice and support when needed.

In most cases, watching TV programmes and playing games are the popular choices, but when the holiday is long enough, children would beg their parents to take them on a trip. I think it's within children\u2019s nature to be curious about the world, so it must be much more exciting to explore new places and make new friends than to stay at home facing the same people and doing the same things.

Travelling is definitely good for people's health. When you travel, chances are that you'll do a lot of hiking, you'll probably participate in a variety of outdoor activities, and you are likely to live a rather regular life due to the disconnection from the Internet and games. On the other hand, games can lead to serious health problems. Games are addictive in nature, to which children are vulnerable.

More importantly, it could provide more opportunities for children and parents to stay together as a family, to understand each other better, and to bond more tightly, so that children can grow in a healthier environment.</p> <p>Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:</p> <ul> <li>recognised /\u02c8r\u025bk\u0259\u0261na\u026azd/: \u8ba4\u51fa\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u627f\u8ba4</li> <li>detriment /\u02c8d\u025btr\u026am\u0259nt/: \u5371\u5bb3</li> <li>travel together /\u02c8tr\u00e6v\u0259l t\u0259\u02c8\u0261\u025b\u00f0\u0259r/: \u4e00\u8d77\u65c5\u884c</li> <li>hiking /\u02c8ha\u026ak\u026a\u014b/: \u5f92\u6b65\u65c5\u884c</li> <li>camping together /\u02c8k\u00e6mp\u026a\u014b t\u0259\u02c8\u0261\u025b\u00f0\u0259r/: \u4e00\u8d77\u9732\u8425</li> <li>sports together /sp\u0254\u02d0rts t\u0259\u02c8\u0261\u025b\u00f0\u0259r/: \u4e00\u8d77\u505a\u8fd0\u52a8</li> <li>outdoors together /\u02cca\u028at\u02c8d\u0254\u02d0rz t\u0259\u02c8\u0261\u025b\u00f0\u0259r/: \u4e00\u8d77\u6237\u5916\u6d3b\u52a8</li> <li>positive influence /\u02c8p\u0252z\u026at\u026av \u02c8\u026anflu\u0259ns/: \u79ef\u6781\u7684\u5f71\u54cd</li> <li>stay together as a family /ste\u026a t\u0259\u02c8\u0261\u025b\u00f0\u0259r \u0259z \u0259 \u02c8f\u00e6m\u0259li/: \u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bb6\u5ead\u4e00\u8d77\u751f\u6d3b</li> <li>understand each other better /\u02cc\u028cnd\u0259r\u02c8st\u00e6nd i\u02d0\u02a7 \u02c8\u028c\u00f0\u0259r \u02c8b\u025bt\u0259r/: \u66f4\u597d\u5730\u76f8\u4e92\u7406\u89e3</li> <li>bond more tightly /b\u0252nd m\u0254\u02d0r \u02c8ta\u026atli/: \u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u5730\u8054\u7cfb</li> <li>healthier environment /\u02c8h\u025bl\u03b8i\u0259r \u026an\u02c8va\u026ar\u0259nm\u0259nt/: \u66f4\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u73af\u5883</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_10/#ielts-speaking-preparation-part-1-school","title":"IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 1 - School","text":"<p>In the first part of the IELTS Speaking test, the examiner will introduce themselves and confirm your identity.

Gradually, I became a big fan.</p> <p>I love a variety of world-class vehicles, but Bugatti Veyron is one of a kind. With the top speed of 430 kilometers per hour, it's the fastest mass-produced vehicle on earth. Its mighty W16 engine can produce as much as 1200 horsepower, and the uniquely designed automatic dual-clutch gearboxes allow nearly no power loss during the transmission, which empowers the vehicle to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h within only 2.5 seconds. But that's not the ultimate facemelter.

Why do some people feel they need to own things?","text":"<p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>Personally, I believe that we all, one way or another, share the same kind of feeling. The craving for possessions is hardwired into people's brains since primitive times when people still had to struggle for existence. People had to collect everything they could get in hand to survive floods, droughts, starvation, plagues, social turbulence, wars, and so on. It gives people a sense of security, which is one of our basic emotional needs.

Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behaviour to children? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.</p> <p>**Essay: **</p> <p>Teaching children the difference between right and wrong at an early age is crucial for their moral development and social integration. I strongly agree that punishment plays a necessary role in helping children understand this distinction, provided it is applied appropriately and constructively.</p> <p>Firstly, punishment can serve as an effective tool for reinforcing disciplinary boundaries. When children engage in undesirable behavior, appropriate consequences help them recognize the implications of their actions. For example, if a child breaks a rule, a temporary loss of privileges can highlight the importance of adhering to established guidelines. This form of constructive punishment fosters a sense of accountability and encourages children to make better choices in the future.</p> <p>Moreover, punishment when combined with positive reinforcement, can significantly enhance a child's understanding of acceptable behavior. Consistent disciplinary measures help children differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable actions, promoting self-discipline and emotional regulation. For instance, setting clear consequences for misbehavior alongside rewards for good behavior creates a balanced approach that supports overall character building.</p> <p>However, it is essential that the punishments used are age-appropriate and non-violent to avoid causing emotional harm or resentment. Parents and teachers should employ methods such as time-outs, loss of privileges, or verbal reprimands rather than physical punishment. These alternative disciplinary strategies not only maintain the child's dignity but also encourage reflective thinking about their actions.</p> <p>In conclusion, while punishment is necessary for teaching children the difference between right and wrong, it must be implemented thoughtfully and in conjunction with positive reinforcement. By using constructive and age-appropriate punishments, parents and teachers can effectively guide children towards ethical and responsible behavior.</p> <p>\u6ce8\u91ca\uff1a</p> <ul> <li>right and wrong /ra\u026at \u00e6nd r\u0252\u014b/: \u5bf9\u4e0e\u9519</li> <li>early age /\u02c8\u025c\u02d0rli e\u026ad\u0292/: \u65e9\u671f</li> <li>moral development /\u02c8m\u0252r\u0259l d\u026a\u02c8v\u025bl\u0259pm\u0259nt/: \u9053\u5fb7\u53d1\u5c55</li> <li>social integration /\u02c8s\u0259\u028a\u0283\u0259l \u02cc\u026ant\u026a\u02c8\u0261re\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u793e\u4f1a\u878d\u5165</li> <li>punishment /\u02c8p\u028cn\u026a\u0283m\u0259nt/: \u60e9\u7f5a</li> <li>disciplinary boundaries /\u02ccd\u026as\u026apl\u026a\u02c8n\u025bri \u02c8ba\u028and\u0259riz/: \u7eaa\u5f8b\u754c\u9650</li> <li>implications /\u02cc\u026ampl\u026a\u02c8ke\u026a\u0283\u0259nz/: \u542b\u4e49</li> <li>constructive punishment /k\u0259n\u02c8str\u028ckt\u026av \u02c8p\u028cn\u026a\u0283m\u0259nt/: \u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u60e9\u7f5a</li> <li>accountability /\u0259\u02ccka\u028ant\u0259\u02c8b\u026al\u0259ti/: \u8d23\u4efb</li> <li>positive reinforcement /\u02c8p\u0252z\u0259t\u026av \u02ccri\u02d0\u026an\u02c8f\u0254\u02d0sm\u0259nt/: \u79ef\u6781\u5f3a\u5316</li> <li>acceptable behavior /\u0259k\u02c8s\u025bpt\u0259bl b\u026a\u02c8he\u026avj\u0259r/: \u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u884c\u4e3a</li> <li>self-discipline /s\u025blf d\u026a\u02c8s\u026apl\u026an/: \u81ea\u5f8b</li> <li>emotional regulation /\u026a\u02c8m\u0259\u028a\u0283\u0259nl \u02ccr\u025bgj\u028a\u02c8le\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u60c5\u7eea\u8c03\u8282</li> <li>character building /\u02c8k\u00e6r\u026akt\u0259r \u02c8b\u026ald\u026a\u014b/: \u54c1\u683c\u57f9\u517b</li> <li>age-appropriate /e\u026ad\u0292 \u0259\u02c8pr\u0259\u028apri\u0259t/: \u9002\u9f84\u7684</li> <li>non-violent /n\u0252n \u02c8va\u026a\u0259l\u0259nt/: \u975e\u66b4\u529b\u7684</li> <li>emotional harm /\u026a\u02c8m\u0259\u028a\u0283\u0259nl h\u0251\u02d0m/: \u60c5\u611f\u4f24\u5bb3</li> <li>resentment /r\u026a\u02c8z\u025bntm\u0259nt/: \u6028\u6068</li> <li>methods /\u02c8m\u025b\u03b8\u0259dz/: \u65b9\u6cd5</li> <li>time-outs /ta\u026am a\u028ats/: \u6682\u505c</li> <li>loss of privileges /l\u0252s \u0259v \u02c8pr\u026av\u026al\u026ad\u0292\u026az/: \u4e27\u5931\u7279\u6743</li> <li>verbal reprimands /\u02c8v\u025c\u02d0b\u0259l r\u026a\u02c8pr\u026am\u0259ndz/: \u53e3\u5934\u8bad\u65a5</li> <li>alternative disciplinary strategies /\u0254\u02d0l\u02c8t\u025c\u02d0rn\u0259t\u026av \u02ccd\u026as\u026apl\u026a\u02c8n\u025bri str\u00e6t\u0259\u02c8d\u0292iz/: \u66ff\u4ee3\u7eaa\u5f8b\u7b56\u7565</li> <li>reflective thinking /r\u026a\u02c8fl\u025bkt\u026av \u02c8\u03b8\u026a\u014bk\u026a\u014b/: \u53cd\u601d\u6027\u601d\u8003</li> <li>ethical and responsible behavior /\u02c8\u025b\u03b8\u026ak\u0259l \u00e6nd r\u026a\u02c8sp\u0252ns\u0259bl b\u026a\u02c8he\u026avj\u0259r/: \u4f26\u7406\u548c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u884c\u4e3a</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_10/#essay-2","title":"Essay 2","text":"<p>Question: ** Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like.

I believe that while allowing students to pursue their interests is important, a balanced approach that also considers future employment prospects is essential.</p> <p>On one hand, allowing students to study subjects they are passionate about fosters personal fulfillment and academic excellence. When students are genuinely interested in their field of study, they are more likely to excel and contribute meaningfully to their chosen disciplines. For example, a student passionate about literature may produce outstanding research that enhances our understanding of cultural narratives. Moreover, diverse academic backgrounds enrich the intellectual environment of universities, promoting innovative thinking and interdisciplinary collaboration.</p> <p>Conversely, proponents of focusing on useful subjects argue that higher education should be aligned with market demands to ensure students are equipped with skills that will lead to employment opportunities. In today\u2019s rapidly evolving job market, expertise in science and technology is highly sought after, offering students better career prospects and financial stability. For instance, graduates with degrees in computer science or engineering often find themselves in high-demand fields with lucrative salaries. This pragmatic approach helps address the skills gap and supports economic growth by producing a workforce adept in innovative technologies.</p> <p>However, it is crucial to recognize that not all students have the same interests or career aspirations. Imposing strict limitations on study choices can lead to academic dissatisfaction and reduce the creativity that stems from diverse fields of study. Therefore, universities should offer a flexible curriculum that allows students to combine their interests with subjects that enhance their future employability. For example, a student studying art could incorporate courses in digital media to broaden their career options in the growing field of creative technologies.</p> <p>In conclusion, while focusing on useful subjects can enhance employment prospects, it is equally important to allow students the freedom to pursue their passions. A balanced approach that integrates both personal interests and market-relevant skills will lead to a more innovative and satisfied workforce, benefiting both individuals and society as a whole.</p> <p>\u6ce8\u91ca\uff1a</p> <ul> <li>study whatever they like /\u02c8st\u028cdi \u02c8w\u028ct\u025bv\u0259r \u00f0e\u026a la\u026ak/: \u5b66\u4e60\u4ed6\u4eec\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u4e1c\u897f</li> <li>useful subjects /\u02c8ju\u02d0sf\u028al \u02c8s\u028cbd\u0292\u026akts/: \u6709\u7528\u7684\u79d1\u76ee</li> <li>science and technology /\u02c8sa\u026a\u0259ns \u00e6nd t\u025bk\u02c8n\u0252l\u0259d\u0292i/: \u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u6280\u672f</li> <li>employment prospects /\u026am\u02c8pl\u0254\u026am\u0259nt pr\u0259\u02c8sp\u025bkts/: \u5c31\u4e1a\u524d\u666f</li> <li>personal fulfillment /\u02c8p\u025c\u02d0s\u0259nl f\u028al\u02c8f\u026alm\u0259nt/: \u4e2a\u4eba\u6ee1\u8db3</li> <li>academic excellence /\u02cc\u00e6k\u0259\u02c8d\u025bm\u026ak \u02c8\u025bks\u0259l\u0259ns/: \u5b66\u672f\u5353\u8d8a</li> <li>literature /\u02c8l\u026at\u0259r\u0259t\u0283\u0259r/: \u6587\u5b66</li> <li>intellectual environment /\u02cc\u026ant\u0259l\u02c8\u025bkt\u0283u\u0259l \u025bn\u02c8va\u026ar\u0259nm\u0259nt/: \u77e5\u8bc6\u73af\u5883</li> <li>innovative thinking /\u02c8\u026an\u0259ve\u026at\u026av \u02c8\u03b8\u026a\u014bk\u026a\u014b/: \u521b\u65b0\u601d\u7ef4</li> <li>interdisciplinary collaboration /\u02cc\u026ant\u0259r\u02ccd\u026as\u0259\u02c8pl\u026an\u0259ri \u02cck\u0252l\u0259\u02c8bre\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5408\u4f5c</li> <li>market demands /\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0k\u026at d\u026a\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0ndz/: \u5e02\u573a\u9700\u6c42</li> <li>employment opportunities /\u026am\u02c8pl\u0254\u026am\u0259nt \u02cc\u0252p\u0259\u02c8tju\u02d0n\u026atiz/: \u5c31\u4e1a\u673a\u4f1a</li> <li>career prospects /k\u0259\u02c8r\u026a\u0259r pr\u0259\u02c8sp\u025bkts/: \u804c\u4e1a\u524d\u666f</li> <li>financial stability /fa\u026a\u02c8n\u00e6n\u0283\u0259l st\u0259\u02c8b\u026al\u0259ti/: \u8d22\u52a1\u7a33\u5b9a</li> <li>computer science /k\u0259m\u02c8pju\u02d0t\u0259r \u02c8sa\u026a\u0259ns/: \u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66</li> <li>engineering /\u02cc\u025bn.d\u0292\u026a\u02c8n\u026a\u0259r\u026a\u014b/: \u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66</li> <li>skills gap /sk\u026alz \u0261\u00e6p/: \u6280\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd</li> <li>innovative technologies /\u02cc\u026an\u0259ve\u026at\u026av t\u025bk\u02c8n\u0252l\u0259d\u0292iz/: \u521b\u65b0\u6280\u672f</li> <li>academic dissatisfaction /\u02cc\u00e6k\u0259\u02c8d\u025bm\u026ak \u02ccd\u026as\u02ccs\u00e6t\u026as\u02c8f\u00e6k\u0283\u0259n/: \u5b66\u672f\u4e0d\u6ee1</li> <li>creativity /kri\u02d0e\u026a\u02c8t\u026av\u026ati/: \u521b\u9020\u529b</li> <li>flexible curriculum /\u02c8fl\u025bks\u026ab\u0259l k\u0259\u02c8r\u026akj\u028al\u0259m/: \u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b</li> <li>future employability /\u02c8fju\u02d0t\u0283\u0259r \u02cc\u026am\u02c8pl\u0254\u026a\u0259b\u026al\u026ati/: \u672a\u6765\u7684\u5c31\u4e1a\u80fd\u529b</li> <li>personal interests /\u02c8p\u025c\u02d0s\u0259nl \u02c8\u026antr\u0259sts/: \u4e2a\u4eba\u5174\u8da3</li> <li>market-relevant skills /\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0k\u026at-r\u025b\u02c8l\u025bv\u0259nt sk\u026alz/: \u4e0e\u5e02\u573a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6280\u80fd</li> <li>innovative /\u02cc\u026an\u0259\u02c8ve\u026at\u026av/: \u521b\u65b0\u7684</li> <li>satisfied /\u02c8s\u00e6t\u026asfa\u026ad/: \u6ee1\u610f\u7684</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_10/#essay-3","title":"Essay 3","text":"<p>Question: ** Countries are becoming more and more similar because people are able to buy the same products anywhere in the world. Do you think this is a positive or negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.</p> <p>Essay:</p> <p>The increasing globalization has led to countries becoming more and more similar as people can purchase the same products anywhere in the world. I believe this development has both positive and negative implications, but the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.</p> <p>On the positive side, the availability of the same products worldwide enhances consumer convenience and economic efficiency. Consumers can access a wide range of goods, ensuring that they can obtain high-quality products regardless of their location. For example, international brands like Apple and Nike are available in numerous countries, providing consumers with consistent quality and reliable service. Additionally, this similarity fosters economic integration as companies expand their operations globally, creating job opportunities and contributing to economic growth in various regions.</p> <p>Moreover, the exchange of goods and services promotes cultural exchange and mutual understanding among different societies. When people use the same products, it creates a shared experience that can bridge cultural gaps and foster international camaraderie. For instance, the widespread use of smartphones has enabled people from diverse backgrounds to connect and communicate seamlessly, enhancing global connectivity and collaboration.</p> <p>However, this trend also has its drawbacks. The homogenization of products can lead to the erosion of local cultures and traditional practices. As international brands dominate the market, local businesses may struggle to compete, resulting in the loss of cultural diversity and unique regional identities. For example, the prevalence of fast food chains like McDonald's can overshadow traditional cuisines, diminishing the richness of local culinary heritage.</p> <p>Furthermore, the reliance on global supply chains can make countries vulnerable to economic fluctuations and market dependencies. Disruptions in one part of the world can have a cascading effect on others, leading to economic instability and supply shortages. The recent pandemic highlighted how interconnected economies are, as shutdowns in one region impacted product availability globally.</p> <p>In conclusion, while the ability to buy the same products worldwide promotes consumer convenience and economic growth, it also poses threats to cultural diversity and economic resilience. Balancing global integration with the preservation of local cultures is essential to ensure that this development remains beneficial rather than detrimental.</p> <p>\u6ce8\u91ca\uff1a</p> <ul> <li>globalization /\u02cc\u0261l\u0259\u028ab\u0259l\u028c\u026a\u02c8ze\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u5168\u7403\u5316</li> <li>products /\u02c8pr\u0252d\u028ckts/: \u4ea7\u54c1</li> <li>positive /\u02c8p\u0252z\u0259t\u026av/: \u79ef\u6781\u7684</li> <li>negative /\u02c8n\u025b\u0261\u0259t\u026av/: \u6d88\u6781\u7684</li> <li>advantages /\u0259d\u02c8v\u0251\u02d0nt\u026ad\u0292\u026az/: \u4f18\u52bf</li> <li>disadvantages /\u02ccd\u026as\u0259d\u02c8v\u0251\u02d0nt\u026ad\u0292\u026az/: \u52a3\u52bf</li> <li>availability of the same products /\u0259\u02ccve\u026al\u0259\u02c8b\u026al\u0259ti \u0259v \u00f0\u0259 se\u026am \u02c8pr\u0252d\u028ckts/: \u76f8\u540c\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u6027</li> <li>consumer convenience /k\u0259n\u02c8sju\u02d0m\u0259r k\u0259n\u02c8vi\u02d0ni\u0259ns/: \u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4fbf\u5229</li> <li>economic efficiency /\u02cci\u02d0k\u0259\u02c8n\u0252m\u026ak \u026a\u02c8f\u026a\u0283\u0259nsi/: \u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u7387</li> <li>Apple /\u02c8\u00e6p\u0259l/: \u82f9\u679c</li> <li>Nike /\u02c8na\u026aki/: \u8010\u514b</li> <li>economic integration /\u02cci\u02d0k\u0259\u02c8n\u0252m\u026ak \u02cc\u026ant\u026a\u02c8\u0261re\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e00\u4f53\u5316</li> <li>job opportunities /d\u0292\u0252b \u02cc\u0252p\u0259\u02c8tju\u02d0n\u026atiz/: \u5c31\u4e1a\u673a\u4f1a</li> <li>economic growth /\u02cci\u02d0k\u0259\u02c8n\u0252m\u026ak \u0261r\u0259\u028a\u03b8/: \u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f</li> <li>exchange of goods and services /\u026aks\u02c8t\u0283e\u026and\u0292 \u0259v \u0261\u028adz \u00e6nd \u02c8s\u025c\u02d0v\u026as\u026az/: \u5546\u54c1\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u4ea4\u6362</li> <li>cultural exchange /\u02c8k\u028clt\u0283\u0259r\u0259l \u026aks\u02c8t\u0283e\u026and\u0292/: \u6587\u5316\u4ea4\u6d41</li> <li>mutual understanding /\u02c8mju\u02d0tj\u028a\u0259l \u02cc\u028cnd\u0259r\u02c8st\u00e6nd\u026a\u014b/: \u76f8\u4e92\u7406\u89e3</li> <li>cultural gaps /\u02c8k\u028clt\u0283\u0259r\u0259l \u0261\u00e6ps/: \u6587\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd</li> <li>international camaraderie /\u02cc\u026ant\u0259\u02c8n\u00e6\u0283\u0259n\u0259l \u02cck\u00e6m\u0259\u02c8r\u025bd\u0259ri/: \u56fd\u9645\u53cb\u60c5</li> <li>smartphones /\u02c8sm\u0251\u02d0rtf\u0259\u028anz/: \u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a</li> <li>global connectivity /\u02c8\u0261l\u0259\u028abl k\u0259\u02ccn\u025bkt\u026a\u02c8v\u026ati/: \u5168\u7403\u8fde\u63a5</li> <li>homogenization /h\u0259\u028am\u0259\u028ad\u0292\u0259na\u026a\u02c8ze\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u540c\u8d28\u5316</li> <li>erosion of local cultures /\u026a\u02c8r\u0259\u028a\u0292\u0259n \u0259v \u02c8l\u0259\u028ak\u0259l \u02c8k\u028clt\u0283\u0259rz/: \u5f53\u5730\u6587\u5316\u7684\u4fb5\u8680</li> <li>traditional practices /tr\u0259\u02c8d\u026a\u0283\u0259n\u0259l \u02c8pr\u00e6kt\u026as\u026az/: \u4f20\u7edf\u4e60\u4fd7</li> <li>cultural diversity /\u02c8k\u028clt\u0283\u0259r\u0259l da\u026a\u02c8v\u025c\u02d0rs\u0259ti/: \u6587\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027</li> <li>unique regional identities /ju\u02c8ni\u02d0k ri\u02c8d\u0292\u0259n\u0259l a\u026a\u02c8d\u025bnt\u026atiz/: \u72ec\u7279\u7684\u533a\u57df\u8eab\u4efd</li> <li>global supply chains /\u02c8\u0261l\u0259\u028abl s\u0259\u02c8pla\u026a t\u0283e\u026anz/: \u5168\u7403\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe</li> <li>economic fluctuations /\u02cci\u02d0k\u0259\u02c8n\u0252m\u026ak fl\u028ckt\u0283u\u02c8e\u026a\u0283\u0259nz/: \u7ecf\u6d4e\u6ce2\u52a8</li> <li>market dependencies /\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0k\u026at d\u026a\u02c8p\u025bnd\u0259nsi\u02d0z/: \u5e02\u573a\u4f9d\u8d56</li> <li>economic instability /\u02cci\u02d0k\u0259\u02c8n\u0252m\u026ak \u02cc\u026anst\u0259\u02c8b\u026al\u0259ti/: \u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a</li> <li>supply shortages /s\u0259\u02c8pla\u026a \u02c8\u0283\u0254\u02d0t\u026ad\u0292\u026az/: \u4f9b\u5e94\u77ed\u7f3a</li> <li>pandemic /p\u00e6n\u02c8d\u025bm\u026ak/: \u5927\u6d41\u884c\u75c5</li> <li>interconnected economies /\u02cc\u026ant\u0259\u02c8k\u0252n\u025bkt\u026ad \u02cci\u02d0k\u0259\u02c8n\u0252miz/: \u4e92\u8054\u7ecf\u6d4e</li> <li>consumer convenience /k\u0259n\u02c8sju\u02d0m\u0259r k\u0259n\u02c8vi\u02d0ni\u0259ns/: \u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4fbf\u5229</li> <li>economic integration /\u02cci\u02d0k\u0259\u02c8n\u0252m\u026ak \u02cc\u026ant\u026a\u02c8\u0261re\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e00\u4f53\u5316</li> <li>detrimental /\u02ccd\u025btr\u026a\u02c8m\u025bntl/: \u6709\u5bb3\u7684</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_10/#essay-4","title":"Essay 4","text":"<p>Question: ** Many museums charge for admission while others are free. Do you think the advantages of charging people for admission to museums outweigh the disadvantages? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.</p> <p>Essay:</p> <p>The decision of whether museums should charge for admission or remain free is a topic of considerable debate. I believe that charging admission offers more advantages than disadvantages, primarily because it ensures financial sustainability and enhances the quality of exhibits.</p> <p>One significant advantage of charging admission is that it provides museums with a reliable source of funding. This financial support is crucial for maintaining and upgrading exhibits, preserving cultural artifacts, and expanding educational programs. For example, renowned institutions like the Louvre and the British Museum charge admission fees, which contribute to their ability to host world-class exhibitions and conduct extensive restoration projects. Without these funds, museums might struggle to preserve their collections and offer engaging experiences to visitors.</p> <p>Moreover, admission fees can help manage visitor numbers, preventing overcrowding and ensuring a more enjoyable and educational experience for guests. By providing a reliable and efficient alternative to road transport, trains can reduce the number of vehicles on highways, decreasing commuting times and enhancing public transportation systems. Cities like London and Paris have benefited from extensive rail networks that support their dense populations and bustling economies.</p> <p>However, charging for admission may create a barrier for individuals from low-income backgrounds, limiting their access to educational resources and cultural enrichment. To mitigate this disadvantage, museums can offer free entry days, discounted tickets for students and seniors, or implement membership programs that provide benefits at a lower cost. For instance, many museums around the world have designated days where admission is free, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to experience and learn from their exhibits regardless of financial constraints.</p> <p>In conclusion, while there are concerns about accessibility when museums charge for admission, the financial benefits and the ability to provide higher quality exhibits make it a worthwhile practice. By implementing measures to ensure affordability, museums can balance the need for sustainable funding with the goal of making cultural education accessible to all.</p> <p>\u6ce8\u91ca\uff1a</p> <ul> <li>advantages /\u0259d\u02c8v\u0251\u02d0nt\u026ad\u0292\u026az/: \u4f18\u52bf</li> <li>disadvantages /\u02ccd\u026as\u0259d\u02c8v\u0251\u02d0nt\u026ad\u0292\u026az/: \u52a3\u52bf</li> <li>financial sustainability /fa\u026a\u02c8n\u00e6n\u0283\u0259l s\u0259\u02ccste\u026an\u0259\u02c8b\u026al\u0259ti/: \u8d22\u52a1\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027</li> <li>quality of exhibits /\u02c8kw\u0252l\u0259ti \u0259v \u026a\u0261\u02c8z\u026ab\u026ats/: \u5c55\u54c1\u8d28\u91cf</li> <li>funding /\u02c8f\u028cnd\u026a\u014b/: \u8d44\u91d1</li> <li>upgrading exhibits /\u028cp\u02c8\u0261re\u026ad\u026a\u014b \u026a\u0261\u02c8z\u026ab\u026ats/: \u5347\u7ea7\u5c55\u54c1</li> <li>cultural artifacts /\u02c8k\u028clt\u0283\u0259r\u0259l \u02c8\u0251\u02d0tf\u00e6kts/: \u6587\u5316\u6587\u7269</li> <li>restoration projects /\u02ccr\u025bst\u0254\u02d0\u02c8re\u026a\u0283\u0259n \u02c8pr\u0252d\u0292\u025bkts/: \u4fee\u590d\u9879\u76ee</li> <li>visitor numbers /\u02c8v\u026az\u026at\u0259r \u02c8n\u028cmb\u0259rz/: \u8bbf\u5ba2\u6570\u91cf</li> <li>educational /\u02cc\u025bdj\u028a\u02c8ke\u026a\u0283\u0259nl/: \u6559\u80b2\u6027\u7684</li> <li>barrier /\u02c8b\u00e6ri\u0259r/: \u969c\u788d</li> <li>low-income /lo\u028a-\u02c8\u026ank\u028cm/: \u4f4e\u6536\u5165\u7684</li> <li>educational resources /\u02cc\u025bdj\u028a\u02c8ke\u026a\u0283\u0259nl r\u026a\u02c8z\u0254\u02d0s\u026az/: \u6559\u80b2\u8d44\u6e90</li> <li>cultural enrichment /\u02c8k\u028clt\u0283\u0259r\u0259l \u025bn\u02c8r\u026a\u02a7m\u0259nt/: \u6587\u5316\u4e30\u5bcc</li> <li>free entry days /fri\u02d0 \u02c8\u025bntri de\u026az/: \u514d\u8d39\u5165\u573a\u65e5</li> <li>discounted tickets /\u02c8d\u026aska\u028ant\u026ad \u02c8t\u026ak\u026ats/: \u6298\u6263\u7968</li> <li>membership programs /\u02c8m\u025bmb\u0259r\u0283\u026ap \u02c8pr\u0259\u028agr\u00e6mz/: \u4f1a\u5458\u8ba1\u5212</li> <li>financial benefits /fa\u026a\u02c8n\u00e6n\u0283\u0259l \u02c8b\u025bn\u026af\u026ats/: \u8d22\u52a1\u5229\u76ca</li> <li>upgrading exhibits /\u028cp\u02c8\u0261re\u026ad\u026a\u014b \u026a\u0261\u02c8z\u026ab\u026ats/: \u5347\u7ea7\u5c55\u54c1</li> <li>sustainable funding /s\u0259\u02c8ste\u026an\u0259bl \u02c8f\u028cnd\u026a\u014b/: \u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8d44\u91d1</li> <li>cultural education /\u02c8k\u028clt\u0283\u0259r\u0259l \u02cc\u025bdj\u028a\u02c8ke\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u6587\u5316\u6559\u80b2</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_11/","title":"Cambridge English IELTS 11","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_11/#speaking","title":"Speaking","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_11/#ielts-speaking-preparation-part-1-food-and-cooking","title":"IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 1 - Food and Cooking","text":"<p>In the first part of the IELTS Speaking test, the examiner will introduce themselves and confirm your identity.

He is a post-modern sculptor and lives in a spacious home-studio located in the Chaoyang District of Beijing, near the North Fifth Ring Road. He named his residence \u201cWu Zhi Zhai\u201d, which translates to \u201cThe House of Innocence and Ignorance\u201d.</p> <p>Uncle Wu's studio was originally an obsolete warehouse. About 20 years ago, he moved to Beijing with nothing but dreams. Unable to afford a decent place in the city, he had to make do with this dilapidated warehouse. At that time, the Fifth Ring Road hadn't been constructed yet, and the warehouse was in a location unknown even to some locals. It was there that he began his journey into art, gradually gaining fame. After earning his first significant income, he decided to purchase the warehouse and transform it into a fascinating artwork.</p> <p>The first major renovation involved replacing the leaky roof with an arrangement of translucent and transparent reinforced glasses, allowing natural light to flood the space. Next, he removed the concrete floor and filled it with soil, making it suitable for planting various types of vegetation. In the southern part of the house, he paved a yard with pebbles and constructed a small two-story house. The garden is adorned with curious-looking metal sculptures that blend seamlessly with the plants, giving them a lifelike appearance.</p> <p>What I particularly admire about Uncle Wu's house is not just its unique architecture but also the underlying philosophy. The artificial sculptures placed amidst the natural greenery symbolize the idea that without the garden, these sculptures would be lifeless. This arrangement serves as a poignant reminder that humans are often innocent and ignorant in the face of nature's grandeur.</p> <p>Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:</p> <ul> <li>home-studio /\u02c8ho\u028am \u02c8stu\u02d0di\u0259\u028a/: \u5bb6\u5ead\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4</li> <li>Chaoyang District /\u02cct\u0283a\u028a\u02c8j\u0251\u02d0\u014b \u02c8d\u026astr\u026akt/: \u671d\u9633\u533a</li> <li>North Fifth Ring Road /n\u0254\u02d0\u03b8 f\u026af\u03b8 r\u026a\u014b ro\u028ad/: \u5317\u4e94\u73af\u8def</li> <li>Wu Zhi Zhai /wu\u02d0 \u02c8\u02a4\u026a za\u026a/: \u5434\u5fd7\u5b85</li> <li>obsolete warehouse /\u02cc\u0252bs\u0259\u02c8li\u02d0t \u02c8w\u025bha\u028as/: \u5e9f\u5f03\u4ed3\u5e93</li> <li>fascinating artwork /\u02c8f\u00e6s\u026ane\u026at\u026a\u014b \u02c8\u0251\u02d0tw\u025c\u02d0rk/: \u8ff7\u4eba\u7684\u827a\u672f\u4f5c\u54c1</li> <li>leaky roof /\u02c8li\u02d0ki ru\u02d0f/: \u6f0f\u6c34\u7684\u5c4b\u9876</li> <li>translucent and transparent reinforced glasses /tr\u00e6nz\u02c8lu\u02d0s\u0259nt \u0259nd tr\u00e6n\u02c8sp\u00e6r\u0259nt r\u026a\u02c8\u026anf\u0254\u02d0rst \u02c8gl\u00e6s\u026az/: \u534a\u900f\u660e\u548c\u900f\u660e\u7684\u94a2\u5316\u73bb\u7483</li> <li>vegetation /\u02ccv\u025bd\u0292\u026a\u02c8te\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u690d\u88ab</li> <li>pebbles /\u02c8p\u025bb\u0259lz/: \u5c0f\u5375\u77f3</li> <li>two-story house /tu\u02d0 \u02c8st\u0254\u02d0ri ha\u028as/: \u4e24\u5c42\u697c\u7684\u623f\u5b50</li> <li>curious-looking metal sculptures /\u02c8kj\u028a\u0259ri\u0259s \u02c8l\u028ak\u026a\u014b \u02c8m\u025bt\u0259l \u02c8sk\u028clpt\u0283\u0259rz/: \u5947\u7279\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u96d5\u5851</li> <li>innocent and ignorant /\u026a\u02c8n\u0252s\u0259nt \u0259nd \u02c8\u026agn\u0259r\u0259nt/: \u5929\u771f\u548c\u65e0\u77e5</li> <li>nature's grandeur /\u02c8ne\u026a\u02a7\u0259rz \u02c8\u0261r\u00e6ndj\u028a\u0259r/: \u81ea\u7136\u7684\u58ee\u4e3d</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_11/#ielts-speaking-preparation-part-3-different-types-of-home","title":"IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Different Types of Home","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_11/#1-what-kinds-of-home-are-most-popular-in-your-country-why-is-this","title":"1.

I believe it's very important for young adults to stop living with their parents so that they can truly learn to take responsibilities and become independent.

They often employ all possible means to ensure their children are safely on the \u201cright track.\" As a result, many young people in China, when faced with trouble, turn to their parents for help instead of seeking solutions independently.

I was in my hometown, Beijing, which was the host city of the 2014 APEC meeting. It was the first day of the APEC meeting in early November. After a long spell of smoggy days in October, we finally saw the azure sky with white clouds. What made it even better was that the temperature was just about right for outdoor activities.</p> <p>In order to celebrate the APEC event, the residents of Beijing were given a few extra days off. Some people chose to travel to other places, but I decided to stay in Beijing to appreciate its scenic beauty on such nice days. A couple of friends and I went to Beihai Park and took quite a few pictures there, including the beautiful white tower and people who were boating on the lake.</p> <p>The great weather of that day was particularly memorable because of the huge contrast between that day and the severely smoggy days before and after it. This weather condition was even coined \u201cAPEC blue\u201d by the media to signify its rarity. After all, it was a result of the government's action that thousands of factories were shut down during that period and the number of vehicles on the streets was also cut in half.

For the inland regions, the weather is usually easier to forecast as it is generally more stable. However, for the coastal areas, especially those in the subtropics which are greatly affected by the subtropical monsoons, it might be much more challenging to predict the weather. The variability in these regions, influenced by factors like ocean currents and humidity levels, makes accurate weather prediction more complex.

It was by far one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.</p> <p>I did not watch it intentionally; I was just flipping through the channels when I came across this show. There was a Maori man with tattoos all over his face who instantly grabbed my attention. His presence and the cultural elements presented in the documentary piqued my interest immediately.</p> <p>During the documentary, I learnt a multitude of things about New Zealand, including its geographical location, climate, and rich cultural heritage. The vast forests and magnificent mountains were showcased so impressively on the screen. It was mentioned that the Lord of the Rings trilogy was filmed there, which added to the allure of the country. As a sports enthusiast, I also discovered that New Zealanders are incredibly passionate about rugby, a sport I have always wanted to try myself.</p> <p>What I found most fascinating about the documentary was the in-depth introduction to Maori culture. It was an eye-opening experience to learn that you can deduce so many aspects, such as accolades and statuses, of a Maori person from the jade they are wearing and the tattoos on their faces. The highlight of the documentary was the haka, originally a war dance intended to intimidate enemies, and now more commonly performed by New Zealand sports teams before a match starts. In the show, a Maori man explained to the audience the meaning behind each hand gesture and pose used in the haka. It was so much fun learning about these cultural practices that I plan to travel to New Zealand very soon to experience all these things with my own eyes.</p>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_11/#advanced-vocabulary-and-phrases_1","title":"Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases","text":"<ul> <li>flipping through the channels /\u02c8fl\u026ap\u026a\u014b \u03b8ru\u02d0 \u00f0\u0259 \u02c8\u02a7\u00e6n\u0259lz/: \u7ffb\u770b\u9891\u9053</li> <li>Maori man /\u02c8ma\u028ari m\u00e6n/: \u6bdb\u5229\u4eba</li> <li>tattoos /t\u00e6\u02c8tu\u02d0z/: \u7eb9\u8eab</li> <li>grabbed my attention /\u0261r\u00e6bd ma\u026a \u0259\u02c8t\u025bn\u0283\u0259n/: \u5438\u5f15\u4e86\u6211\u7684\u6ce8\u610f</li> <li>piqued my interest /pi\u02d0kt ma\u026a \u02c8\u026antr\u0259st/: \u6fc0\u8d77\u4e86\u6211\u7684\u5174\u8da3</li> <li>geographical location /\u02ccd\u0292i\u02d0\u0259\u02c8\u0261r\u00e6f\u026ak\u0259l lo\u028a\u02c8ke\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e</li> <li>rich cultural heritage /r\u026a\u02a7 \u02c8k\u028clt\u0283\u0259r\u0259l \u02c8h\u025br\u026at\u026ad\u0292/: \u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7</li> <li>vast forests /v\u00e6st \u02c8f\u0252r\u026asts/: \u5e7f\u9614\u7684\u68ee\u6797</li> <li>magnificent mountains /m\u00e6\u0261\u02c8n\u026af\u0259s\u0259nt \u02c8ma\u028ant\u0259nz/: \u96c4\u4f1f\u7684\u5c71\u8109</li> <li>Lord of the Rings trilogy /l\u0254\u02d0rd \u0259v \u00f0\u0259 r\u026a\u014bz \u02c8tr\u026al\u0259d\u0292i/: \u300a\u6307\u73af\u738b\u300b\u4e09\u90e8\u66f2</li> <li>sports enthusiast /sp\u0254\u02d0rts \u026an\u02c8\u03b8ju\u02d0zi\u00e6st/: \u4f53\u80b2\u7231\u597d\u8005</li> <li>New Zealanders /nu\u02d0 \u02c8zi\u02d0l\u0259nd\u0259rz/: \u65b0\u897f\u5170\u4eba</li> <li>passionate about /\u02c8p\u00e6\u0283\u0259n\u0259t \u0259\u02c8ba\u028at/: \u70ed\u8877\u4e8e</li> <li>fascinating /\u02c8f\u00e6s\u026ane\u026at\u026a\u014b/: \u8ff7\u4eba\u7684</li> <li>introduction to Maori culture /\u02cc\u026antr\u0259\u02c8d\u028ck\u0283\u0259n tu\u02d0 \u02c8ma\u028ari \u02c8k\u028clt\u0283\u0259r/: \u6bdb\u5229\u6587\u5316\u4ecb\u7ecd</li> <li>eye-opening experience /\u02cca\u026a\u02c8o\u028ap\u0259n\u026a\u014b \u026ak\u02c8sp\u026a\u0259r\u026a\u0259ns/: \u5f00\u9614\u773c\u754c\u7684\u7ecf\u5386</li> <li>deduce /d\u026a\u02c8dju\u02d0s/: \u63a8\u65ad</li> <li>accolades /\u02c8\u00e6k\u0259le\u026adz/: \u8363\u8a89</li> <li>statuses /\u02c8ste\u026at\u0259siz/: \u72b6\u6001</li> <li>jade /d\u0292e\u026ad/: \u7389</li> <li>highlight /\u02c8ha\u026a\u02ccla\u026at/: \u9ad8\u5149</li> <li>haka /\u02c8h\u0251\u02d0k\u0259/: \u54c8\u5361\u821e</li> <li>war dance /w\u0254\u02d0r d\u00e6ns/: \u6218\u821e</li> <li>intimidate enemies /\u026an\u02c8t\u026am\u026ade\u026at \u02c8\u025bn\u0259miz/: \u5a01\u80c1\u654c\u4eba</li> <li>explained to the audience /\u026ak\u02c8sple\u026and tu\u02d0 \u00f0i \u02c8\u0254\u02d0di\u0259ns/: \u5411\u89c2\u4f17\u89e3\u91ca</li> <li>hand gesture /h\u00e6nd \u02c8d\u0292\u025bst\u0283\u0259r/: \u624b\u52bf</li> <li>pose /po\u028az/: \u59ff\u52bf</li> <li>plan to travel /pl\u00e6n tu\u02d0 \u02c8tr\u00e6v\u0259l/: \u8ba1\u5212\u65c5\u884c</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_11/#ielts-speaking-preparation-part-3-different-types-of-tv-programmes","title":"IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Different Types of TV Programmes","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_11/#1-what-are-the-most-popular-kinds-of-tv-programmes-in-your-country-why-is-this","title":"1.

Although there have been more and more game shows on TV, they still constitute a small percentage of all TV programmes.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.</p> <p>Essay:</p> <p>Governments should prioritize spending on railways rather than roads to enhance a country's infrastructure and promote sustainable development. I strongly agree with this statement because investing in railways offers numerous economic, environmental, and social benefits.</p> <p>Firstly, railways are more environmentally friendly compared to roads. Trains emit significantly fewer greenhouse gases per passenger kilometer than cars and buses, contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions. For example, the expansion of high-speed rail networks in countries like Japan and Germany has led to decreased reliance on air travel and private vehicles, thereby mitigating air pollution and combating climate change.</p> <p>Secondly, investing in railways can stimulate economic growth. Efficient rail systems facilitate the movement of goods and people, reducing transportation costs and time. This connectivity is crucial for business operations, as it enables smoother logistics and access to wider markets. For instance, the development of the European Union's rail network has enhanced trade and mobility among member states, fostering economic integration and cooperation.</p> <p>Moreover, railways can alleviate traffic congestion on roads, leading to improved urban mobility and quality of life. By providing a reliable and efficient alternative to road transport, trains can reduce the number of vehicles on highways, decreasing commuting times and enhancing public transportation systems. Cities like London and Paris have benefited from extensive rail networks that support their dense populations and bustling economies.</p> <p>However, it is essential to maintain a balanced approach. While railways offer significant advantages, roads remain indispensable for last-mile connectivity and rural accessibility. Therefore, governments should allocate funds to both rail and road infrastructure, ensuring comprehensive and integrated transportation systems.</p> <p>In conclusion, prioritizing spending on railways over roads is a strategic decision that promotes environmental sustainability, economic efficiency, and social well-being. The long-term benefits of robust rail networks justify the initial investment, making it a preferable choice for modern governments.</p> <p>\u6ce8\u91ca\uff1a</p> <ul> <li>railways /\u02c8re\u026alw\u0259z/: \u94c1\u8def</li> <li>roads /ro\u028adz/: \u9053\u8def</li> <li>infrastructure /\u02c8\u026anfr\u0259\u02ccstr\u028ckt\u0283\u0259r/: \u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd</li> <li>sustainable development /s\u0259\u02c8ste\u026an\u0259b\u0259l d\u026a\u02c8v\u025bl\u0259pm\u0259nt/: \u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55</li> <li>environmentally friendly /\u026an\u02ccva\u026ar\u0259n\u02c8m\u025bntl\u026a \u02c8fr\u025bndli/: \u73af\u4fdd\u7684</li> <li>greenhouse gases /\u02c8\u0261ri\u02d0n\u02ccha\u028as \u02c8\u0261\u00e6s\u026az/: \u6e29\u5ba4\u6c14\u4f53</li> <li>carbon emissions /\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0rb\u0259n \u026a\u02c8m\u026a\u0283\u0259nz/: \u78b3\u6392\u653e</li> <li>air pollution /\u025b\u0259r p\u0259\u02c8lu\u02d0\u0283\u0259n/: \u7a7a\u6c14\u6c61\u67d3</li> <li>climate change /\u02c8kla\u026am\u0259t t\u0283e\u026and\u0292/: \u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316</li> <li>movement of goods and people /\u02c8mu\u02d0vm\u0259nt \u0259v \u0261\u028adz \u00e6nd \u02c8pi\u02d0p\u0259l/: \u8d27\u7269\u548c\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u6d41\u52a8</li> <li>business operations /\u02c8b\u026azn\u0259s \u02cc\u0252p\u0259\u02c8re\u026a\u0283\u0259nz/: \u5546\u4e1a\u8fd0\u8425</li> <li>European Union's rail network /\u02ccj\u028a\u0259r\u0259\u02c8pi\u02d0\u0259n ju\u02d0\u02c8ni\u0259nz re\u026al \u02c8n\u025btw\u025c\u02d0k/: \u6b27\u6d32\u8054\u76df\u7684\u94c1\u8def\u7f51\u7edc</li> <li>economic integration /\u02cci\u02d0k\u0259\u02c8n\u0252m\u026ak \u02cc\u026ant\u026a\u02c8\u0261re\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e00\u4f53\u5316</li> <li>traffic congestion /\u02c8tr\u00e6f\u026ak k\u0259n\u02c8d\u0292\u025bst\u0283\u0259n/: \u4ea4\u901a\u62e5\u5835</li> <li>urban mobility /\u02c8\u025c\u02d0b\u0259n m\u0259\u028a\u02c8b\u026al\u0259ti/: \u57ce\u5e02\u6d41\u52a8\u6027</li> <li>commuting times /k\u0259\u02c8mju\u02d0t\u026a\u014b ta\u026amz/: \u901a\u52e4\u65f6\u95f4</li> <li>public transportation /\u02c8p\u028cbl\u026ak \u02cctr\u00e6ns.p\u0254\u02d0\u02c8te\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u516c\u5171\u4ea4\u901a</li> <li>last-mile connectivity /l\u00e6st ma\u026al k\u0259\u02ccn\u025bkt\u026a\u02c8v\u026ati/: \u6700\u540e\u4e00\u82f1\u91cc\u7684\u8fde\u63a5</li> <li>rural accessibility /\u02c8r\u028a\u0259r\u0259l \u02cc\u00e6ks\u025bs\u026a\u02c8b\u026al\u0259ti/: \u519c\u6751\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027</li> <li>environmental sustainability /\u026an\u02ccva\u026ar\u0259n\u02c8m\u025bntl s\u0259\u02ccste\u026an\u0259\u02c8b\u026al\u0259ti/: \u73af\u5883\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027</li> <li>economic efficiency /\u02cci\u02d0k\u0259\u02c8n\u0252m\u026ak \u026a\u02c8f\u026a\u0283\u0259nsi/: \u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u7387</li> <li>social well-being /\u02c8s\u0259\u028a\u0283\u0259l w\u025bl\u02c8bi\u02d0\u026a\u014b/: \u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u7949</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_11/#essay-2","title":"Essay 2","text":"<p>Question</p> <p>In the future, nobody will buy printed newspapers or books because they will be able to read everything they want online without paying. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.</p> <p>Essay:</p> <p>The rapid advancement of digital technology has transformed the way we consume information, leading some to predict that printed newspapers and books will become obsolete. I partially agree with this statement, as while digital reading will dominate, there will still be a market for printed materials.</p> <p>One significant advantage of online reading is its accessibility and convenience. Digital platforms allow users to access a vast array of information instantly from anywhere, often at a lower cost or for free. For example, e-books can be downloaded to various devices, eliminating the need for physical storage and making it easier to carry multiple books at once. Additionally, online newspapers can be updated in real-time, providing the latest news without waiting for the next day's print edition. These benefits make digital reading an attractive option for many, contributing to the decline of printed materials.</p> <p>However, there are still compelling reasons why printed newspapers and books will continue to be relevant. Many people prefer the tactile experience of reading on paper, finding it more enjoyable and easier on the eyes compared to screens. Moreover, printed materials do not rely on electronic devices or internet connectivity, making them accessible in environments where digital access is limited. For instance, books are often cherished as collectibles and passed down through generations, preserving cultural heritage. Furthermore, certain academic and professional fields still rely heavily on printed resources for their credibility and permanence.</p> <p>In conclusion, while digital reading will increasingly overshadow printed newspapers and books due to its convenience and accessibility, there will remain a niche market for printed materials driven by personal preferences and specific needs.</p> <p>\u6ce8\u91ca\uff1a</p> <ul> <li>digital technology /\u02c8d\u026ad\u0292\u026atl t\u025bk\u02c8n\u0252l\u0259d\u0292i/: \u6570\u5b57\u6280\u672f</li> <li>consume information /k\u0259n\u02c8sju\u02d0m \u02cc\u026anf\u0259\u02c8me\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u6d88\u8d39\u4fe1\u606f</li> <li>printed newspapers and books /\u02c8pr\u026ant\u026ad \u02c8nju\u02d0z\u02ccpe\u026ap\u0259z \u00e6nd b\u028aks/: \u7eb8\u8d28\u62a5\u7eb8\u548c\u4e66\u7c4d</li> <li>obsolete /\u02cc\u0252bs\u0259li\u02c8\u025bs\u0259nt/: \u9010\u6e10\u6dd8\u6c70\u7684</li> <li>digital reading /\u02c8d\u026ad\u0292\u026atl \u02c8ri\u02d0d\u026a\u014b/: \u6570\u5b57\u9605\u8bfb</li> <li>printed materials /\u02c8pr\u026ant\u026ad m\u0259\u02c8t\u026a\u0259ri\u0259lz/: \u5370\u5237\u6750\u6599</li> <li>online reading /\u02c8\u0252n\u02ccla\u026an \u02c8ri\u02d0d\u026a\u014b/: \u5728\u7ebf\u9605\u8bfb</li> <li>accessibility and convenience /\u0259k\u02ccs\u025bs\u026a\u02c8b\u026al\u0259ti \u00e6nd k\u0259n\u02c8vi\u02d0ni\u0259ns/: \u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u548c\u4fbf\u5229\u6027</li> <li>digital platforms /\u02c8d\u026ad\u0292\u026atl \u02c8pl\u00e6tf\u0254\u02d0mz/: \u6570\u5b57\u5e73\u53f0</li> <li>e-books /i\u02d0-b\u028aks/: \u7535\u5b50\u4e66</li> <li>physical storage /\u02c8f\u026az\u026akl \u02c8st\u0254\u02d0r\u026ad\u0292/: \u7269\u7406\u5b58\u50a8</li> <li>real-time /\u02c8r\u026a\u0259l ta\u026am/: \u5b9e\u65f6</li> <li>tactile experience /\u02c8t\u00e6kt\u028c\u026al \u026ak\u02c8sp\u026a\u0259r\u026a\u0259ns/: \u89e6\u89c9\u4f53\u9a8c</li> <li>electronic devices /\u026a\u02ccl\u025bktr\u0252n\u026ak d\u026a\u02c8va\u026as\u026az/: \u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907</li> <li>internet connectivity /\u02c8\u026ant\u0259n\u025bt k\u0259\u02ccn\u025bkt\u026a\u02c8v\u026ati/: \u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u8fde\u63a5</li> <li>digital access /\u02c8d\u026ad\u0292\u026atl \u02c8\u00e6ks\u025bs/: \u6570\u5b57\u8bbf\u95ee</li> <li>cultural heritage /\u02c8k\u028clt\u0283\u0259r\u0259l \u02c8h\u025br\u026at\u026ad\u0292/: \u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7</li> <li>academic and professional fields /\u02cc\u00e6k\u0259\u02c8d\u025bm\u026ak \u00e6nd pr\u0259\u02c8f\u025b\u0283\u0259nl fi\u02d0ldz/: \u5b66\u672f\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df</li> <li>printed resources /\u02c8pr\u026ant\u026ad r\u026a\u02c8z\u0254\u02d0s\u026az/: \u5370\u5237\u8d44\u6e90</li> <li>credibility and permanence /kr\u026a\u02c8d\u026ab\u026al\u0259ti \u00e6nd \u02c8p\u025c\u02d0m\u0259n\u0259ns/: \u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u6c38\u4e45\u6027</li> <li>niche market /ni\u02d0\u0283 \u02c8m\u0251\u02d0k\u026at/: \u5229\u57fa\u5e02\u573a</li> <li>personal preferences /\u02c8p\u025c\u02d0s\u0259nl \u02ccpr\u025bf(\u0259)\u02c8r\u025bnsiz/: \u4e2a\u4eba\u504f\u597d</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_11/#essay-3","title":"Essay 3","text":"<p>Question</p> <p>Some people say that History is one of the most important school subjects.

Some argue that History is crucial for understanding our past, while others believe that Science and Technology subjects are more relevant in today's world.</p> <p>Proponents of History emphasize that it teaches us about our heritage and helps prevent past mistakes. By learning about historical events, students can gain insights into societal developments and cultural identities. For example, studying world wars can highlight the consequences of conflict, promoting peace and empathy. Furthermore, History fosters critical thinking by analyzing cause and effect relationships over time.</p> <p>Conversely, supporters of Science and Technology subjects argue that they are essential for future innovation and economic growth. In an increasingly globalized world, skills in these areas are in high demand. For instance, knowledge in computer science or biotechnology can lead to advancements that improve quality of life. Additionally, these subjects encourage problem-solving and creativity, which are valuable in various career paths.</p> <p>In my opinion, while History provides important lessons from the past, Science and Technology subjects are more critical in preparing students for the future.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of giving children this message? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.</p> <p>Essay:</p> <p>Encouraging children by telling them they can achieve anything with enough effort is a common practice in many cultures. While this message can inspire and motivate, it also has potential drawbacks that need to be considered.</p> <p>One significant advantage of this message is that it fosters a strong work ethic and resilience in children. Believing that hard work can overcome obstacles encourages persistence and dedication, essential traits for personal and professional success. For example, a child who is told they can excel academically if they study diligently is more likely to develop effective study habits and a commitment to learning. Additionally, this positive reinforcement can boost self-esteem and confidence, enabling children to take on challenges and pursue their goals with determination.</p> <p>However, there are also disadvantages to this approach. Telling children they can achieve anything may set unrealistic expectations, leading to disappointment and frustration when they encounter failures. For instance, a child who is constantly told they can become a professional athlete might experience significant stress and anxiety if they do not possess the necessary talent or face injuries. Furthermore, this message can overlook the importance of external factors such as socio-economic status, access to resources, and inherent abilities, which play crucial roles in achieving success. Consequently, children might develop a skewed perception of reality, believing that effort alone is sufficient to overcome all barriers.</p> <p>In my opinion, while encouraging children to strive for their goals is beneficial, it is equally important to teach them about the complexities and challenges they may face. Balancing motivation with realistic expectations can help children develop both ambition and resilience.</p> <p>\u6ce8\u91ca\uff1a</p> <ul> <li>fosters a strong work ethic /\u02c8f\u0252st\u0259z \u0259 str\u0252\u014b w\u025c\u02d0k \u02c8\u025b\u03b8\u026ak/: \u57f9\u517b\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u9053\u5fb7</li> <li>resilience /r\u026a\u02c8z\u026ali\u0259ns/: \u97e7\u6027</li> <li>positive reinforcement /\u02c8p\u0252z\u0259t\u026av \u02ccri\u02d0\u026an\u02c8f\u0254\u02d0sm\u0259nt/: \u79ef\u6781\u7684\u5f3a\u5316</li> <li>self-esteem /s\u025blf \u026a\u02c8sti\u02d0m/: \u81ea\u5c0a</li> <li>realistic expectations /\u02ccri\u02d0\u0259\u02c8l\u026ast\u026ak \u02cc\u025bksp\u025bk\u02c8te\u026a\u0283\u0259nz/: \u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u671f\u671b</li> <li>overcome obstacles /\u02cc\u0259\u028av\u0259r\u02c8k\u028cm \u02c8\u0252bst\u0259k\u0259lz/: \u514b\u670d\u969c\u788d</li> <li>persistence /p\u0259\u02c8s\u026ast\u0259ns/: \u575a\u6301</li> <li>dedication /\u02ccd\u025bd\u026a\u02c8ke\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u5949\u732e</li> <li>personal and professional success /\u02ccp\u025c\u02d0s\u0259nl \u00e6nd pr\u0259\u02c8f\u025b\u0283\u0259nl s\u0259k\u02c8s\u025bs/: \u4e2a\u4eba\u548c\u804c\u4e1a\u6210\u529f</li> <li>commitment to learning /k\u0259\u02c8m\u026atm\u0259nt t\u0259 \u02c8l\u025c\u02d0n\u026a\u014b/: \u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u627f\u8bfa</li> <li>unrealistic expectations /\u02cc\u028cnri\u02d0\u0259\u02c8l\u026ast\u026ak \u02cc\u025bksp\u025bk\u02c8te\u026a\u0283\u0259nz/: \u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u671f\u671b</li> <li>significant stress and anxiety /s\u026a\u0261\u02c8n\u026af\u026ak\u0259nt str\u025bs \u00e6nd \u00e6\u014b\u02c8za\u026a\u0259ti/: \u91cd\u5927\u7684\u538b\u529b\u548c\u7126\u8651</li> <li>skewed perception of reality /skju\u02d0d p\u0259\u02c8s\u025bp\u0283\u0259n \u0259v ri\u02c8\u00e6l\u026ati/: \u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u504f\u9887\u8ba4\u77e5</li> <li>external factors /\u026ak\u02c8st\u025c\u02d0n\u0259l \u02c8fakt\u0259z/: \u5916\u90e8\u56e0\u7d20</li> <li>socio-economic status /\u02ccs\u0259\u028as\u026a\u0259\u028a\u02cc\u025bk\u0259\u02c8n\u0252m\u026ak \u02c8ste\u026at\u0259s/: \u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u4f4d</li> <li>access to resources /\u02c8\u00e6ks\u025bs t\u0259 r\u026a\u02c8z\u0254\u02d0s\u026az/: \u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u83b7\u53d6</li> <li>inherent abilities /\u026an\u02c8h\u026a\u0259r\u0259nt \u0259\u02c8b\u026al\u026atiz/: \u56fa\u6709\u80fd\u529b</li> <li>balanced motivation /\u02c8b\u00e6l\u0259nst \u02ccm\u0259\u028at\u026a\u02c8ve\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_12/","title":"Cambridge English IELTS 12","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_12/#speaking","title":"Speaking","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_12/#ielts-speaking-preparation-part-1-health","title":"IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 1 - Health","text":"<p>In the first part of the IELTS Speaking test, the examiner will introduce themselves and confirm your identity.

Once you have put them on your calendar, a reminder will pop up on the screen and the alarm clock will go off one hour before the event.

She made her film debut in 1998 and quickly gained international recognition by playing a memorable character in the Oscar-winning film \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\u201d Since then, Zhang Ziyi has appeared in a myriad of influential films spanning various genres, including comedy, thriller, action, and even art films.</p> <p>From what I know, Zhang Ziyi has a strong background in the performing arts. She studied dancing in high school and later attended the Central Academy of Drama, one of China\u2019s most prestigious acting schools. She is married to Wang Feng, a famous rock singer, and together they have a daughter. Her dedication to her craft is evident in her continuous effort to refine her acting skills.</p> <p>Speaking of her popularity, Zhang Ziyi first drew public attention when she was handpicked by the renowned director Zhang Yimou to play the leading role in her debut film. Her training in dancing allowed her to deliver breathtaking performances in three well-known Kungfu films: \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\u201d \u201cHero,\u201d and \u201cHouse of Flying Daggers.\u201d She imbued her Kungfu moves with elegance and vivacity, leaving a lasting impression on audiences worldwide.</p> <p>Furthermore, Zhang Ziyi has been steadily polishing her acting skills to perfection.

She made her film debut in 1998 and shortly after that, she got her big break by playing a memorable character in the Oscar-winning film \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\u201d Since then, she has appeared in a number of influential films across many different genres, including comedy, thriller, action, and even art films.</p> <p>From what I know, Zhang Ziyi studied dancing in high school and attended the Central Academy of Drama, one of China's most prestigious acting schools. She is married to Wang Feng, a famous rock singer, and together they have a daughter.</p> <p>Speaking of her popularity, Zhang Ziyi first drew public attention because she was picked by the famous director Zhang Yimou to play the leading role in her first film. Later, thanks to her training in dancing, she was able to put on breathtaking performances in three well-known Kungfu films: \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\u201d \u201cHero,\u201d and \u201cHouse of Flying Daggers.\u201d She was able to give elegance and vivacity to her Kungfu moves, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.</p> <p>From then on, she has been slowly but surely polishing her acting skills to perfection. With the outstanding job she did in \u201cThe Grand Master,\u201d she won all major Chinese film awards for best actress in a leading role. Until today, no other Chinese actress has been able to achieve that with just one film. Such an achievement certainly helped her gain popularity among film-goers of all ages.

During the Qing Dynasty, it became so popular that almost everyone could sing one song or two from the most famous plays.</p> <p>Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:</p> <ul> <li>played a rather significant part /ple\u026ad \u0259 \u02c8r\u00e6\u00f0\u0259r s\u026a\u0261\u02c8n\u026af\u026ak\u0259nt p\u0251\u02d0rt/: \u626e\u6f14\u76f8\u5f53\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89d2\u8272</li> <li>Beijing Opera /\u02ccbe\u026a\u02c8d\u0292\u026a\u014b \u02c8\u0252pr\u0259/: \u4eac\u5267</li> <li>dates back to /de\u026ats b\u00e6k tu\u02d0/: \u8ffd\u6eaf\u5230</li> <li>national treasure /\u02c8n\u00e6\u0283\u0259nl \u02c8tr\u025b\u0292\u0259r/: \u56fd\u5bb6\u7470\u5b9d</li> <li>Qing Dynasty /\u02a7\u026a\u014b \u02c8da\u026an\u0259sti/: \u6e05\u671d</li> <li>sing one song or two /s\u026a\u014b w\u028cn s\u0254\u02d0\u014b \u0254\u02d0r tu\u02d0/: \u5531\u4e00\u4e24\u9996\u6b4c</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_12/#2-how-strong-a-tradition-is-it-today-in-your-country-to-go-to-the-theatre-whywhy-not","title":"2.

I mean, I'm probably one of the least financially savvy people in the world. But I guess I can talk about a discussion I once had with my best friend.</p> <p>First, let me tell you something about my best friend, Lily. We go way back, and she was always a precocious child. Unlike other young people, including myself, who always have an empty wallet towards the end of each month, she spends her money wisely. It seems that she always knows how to get her money's worth for whatever she buys. </p> <p>So, one day this topic came up in our conversation, and I asked her about her secret to money management. And she told me that the first step is, surprise surprise, creating a budget. As a hopeless impulse shopper, I asked her how to avoid buying things on the spur of the moment. She said that her trick was to reward herself with occasional treats, like going to the spa or the theater, just to keep her spirits up. That's why she always sets aside a small amount of money in her budget for those things.</p> <p>I remember we also argued about whether it's better to buy name brands or generic brands.

Why do some parents give their children money to spend each week?","text":"<p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>Well, I think there are a couple of reasons why parents give their children allowances, but the most important one is to teach their children financial literacy. Allowances are a child's first exposure to money management, and they can also be a powerful tool to teach them about patience and decision-making. For example, if they really want an expensive toy, they have to decide whether they should save up to buy it or rethink its value. I understand some parents are worried that free money could spoil children, but I believe it's really up to what kind of strategies the parents use.

It seems to me that people value equality above growth, and when there's a significant disparity between the rich and the poor, it can foster a widespread sense of injustice among the lower class. Those who are less affluent may feel less secure because there is a breakdown in social cohesion and trust. Additionally, wealth tends to concentrate in the hands of a few powerful individuals, exacerbating the imbalance. This natural tendency leads to inequitable distribution of resources, making it difficult for the less privileged to improve their circumstances.

Just as the wealth gap within a country can lead to social issues, global economic inequality also has detrimental effects on world peace and international trade. However, by \"help,\" I don't mean simply providing aid during disasters, but rather regular, continuous economic aid is likely to foster better economic stability. This is because financial support can help underdeveloped regions improve their infrastructure and education systems, thereby reducing poverty and fostering a more stable and peaceful global community.

You should say:</p> <ul> <li>who you visited</li> <li>where this person worked</li> <li>why you visited this person's workplace</li> <li>and explain how you felt about visiting this person's workplace.</li> </ul> <p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>Companies and organizations in China don't often have open house days for visitors. So, I guess I can talk about a time when I visited a friend at her studio where she set up her own business.</p> <p>First, let me tell you something about my friend, Joanne, who is an avid traveller. She used to have an office job but decided to quit because she couldn't stand the monotony. As luck would have it, during one of her trips, she met a computer programmer who shared her vision, and together they built a website that features original and inexpensive travel plans for young people. But the real \u201cwow\" factor of her business is the studio she designed, which is in a shipping container, no less.</p> <p>Although it took me almost two hours to finally get to the studio, which is in a suburb, it blew me away the moment I saw it. She had window walls installed, which make the room bright and airy. The outside of the container was painted bright orange, creating a lovely contrast against the trees that surrounded it. There's even a patio, which was an unfolding door. Inside, there wasn't much room, but it felt very cozy with old furniture, travel photos on the wall, and knick-knacks collected during trips. I wouldn't say it's the best workplace I've ever seen, but it certainly is one of the most special. I'm really happy that my friend is enjoying her life and work.

Color is also a significant factor. People doing creative jobs may prefer to have bright, bold colors in their office, while others might find it hard to concentrate in such a place and prefer traditional, opaque walls and neutral-colored furniture.

In fact, some philosophers have imagined a society where people don't have to work for an income, and products are distributed based on needs. Personally, I don't think such a system will ever be viable because humans are programmed to be opportunists, always seeking to take advantage of available opportunities.

Are all jobs of equal importance?","text":"<p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>Well, I guess to answer this question, we first have to delineate what we mean by \"importance.\" If it refers to how much wealth a job generates, then clearly some jobs are more important than others. For instance, one could argue that a teacher's job is more important than a hedge fund manager's because education cannot be measured by money. However, in terms of the intrinsic value of work, which involves serving a purpose and making an honest living, I believe all jobs are equal.

Why do some people become workaholics?","text":"<p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>Well, I tend to think there are two kinds of workaholism. The first kind is when people adore their work and get a tremendous sense of achievement from it. As a result, they often seem very absorbed in their work and may have a tendency to overwork. However, I'm not sure if this should really be considered workaholism because isn't this what people need to do to become successful? Being driven and willing to work hard is essential for career growth. On the other hand, there are other workaholics who use work as an escape from other social or emotional pressures that they don't want to deal with. In this case, they may display more obsessive-compulsive behaviors that will take a toll on not only their health but also their career.</p> <p>Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:</p> <ul>

However, the person I'd like to talk about is truly a pioneer\u2014his name is Mr. Luo.</p> <p>First, I'll explain what he does. Originally, Mr. Luo was an anchor at Chinese Central Television, a job many people would kill for. However, he noticed an opportunity when more and more Chinese people began using WeChat, an instant messaging and social networking app. Seizing this opportunity, he quit his stable job and embarked on his entrepreneurial journey. He started by opening an account to share book reviews and mini lectures on WeChat. Gradually, his account amassed such a huge following that he expanded his venture by launching a website. On this platform, he collaborates with well-known writers and professors to offer online courses for a fee.</p> <p>Contrary to the popular belief that people won't pay for anything they read online, Mr. Luo's business has gone from strength to strength. Not only have people been willing to \u201cpay for knowledge,\u201d but they have also remained very loyal to his website, eagerly consuming everything that was on offer. Of course, Mr. Luo's success was no accident. He didn't gain attention right away; instead, he made a name for himself by delivering a high-quality mini lecture every single morning for two years straight. Additionally, his keen insight into the needs of China's rising middle class\u2014who are hungry for information and knowledge that they believe would help them increase their wealth or improve the quality of their lives\u2014played a significant role in his success.</p> <p>I wouldn't say that he is my role model because I think I lack the business acumen and charisma he possesses. However, I do admire his persistence and courage to challenge the status quo. While I don't believe I could do the same kind of work as he does, I would love to start a course on his website one day if I had the chance. Although I think there's little likelihood of this happening because I don't think I've got what it takes to be a lecturer!</p>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_13/#advanced-vocabulary-and-phrases","title":"Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases","text":"<ul> <li>entrepreneurship /\u02cc\u0251\u02d0ntr\u0259pr\u0259\u02c8n\u025c\u02d0r\u0283\u026ap/: \u521b\u4e1a\u7cbe\u795e</li> <li>pioneer /\u02c8pa\u026a\u0259ri\u0259r/: \u5148\u950b</li> <li>anchor /\u02c8\u00e6\u014bk\u0259r/: \u65b0\u95fb\u4e3b\u64ad</li> <li>kill for /k\u026al f\u0254\u02d0r/: \u6781\u529b\u4e89\u53d6</li> <li>opportunity /\u02cc\u0252p\u0259r\u02c8tju\u02d0n\u0259ti/: \u673a\u4f1a</li> <li>quit /kw\u026at/: \u8f9e\u804c</li> <li>seizing the opportunity /\u02c8si\u02d0z\u026a\u014b \u00f0i \u02cc\u0252p\u0259r\u02c8tju\u02d0n\u0259ti/: \u6293\u4f4f\u673a\u4f1a</li> <li>book reviews /b\u028ak r\u026a\u02c8vju\u02d0z/: \u4e66\u8bc4</li> <li>mini lectures /\u02c8m\u026an\u026a \u02c8l\u025bkt\u0283\u0259rz/: \u5c0f\u578b\u8bb2\u5ea7</li> <li>huge following /hju\u02d0d\u0292 \u02c8f\u0252l\u0259\u028a\u026a\u014b/: \u5927\u91cf\u8ffd\u968f\u8005</li> <li>website /\u02c8w\u025bb\u02ccsa\u026at/: \u7f51\u7ad9</li> <li>well-known writers /\u02ccw\u025bl\u02c8no\u028an \u02c8ra\u026at\u0259rz/: \u77e5\u540d\u4f5c\u5bb6</li> <li>professors /pr\u0259\u02c8f\u025bs\u0259rz/: \u6559\u6388</li> <li>online courses /\u02c8\u0252n\u02ccla\u026an \u02c8k\u0254\u02d0rs\u026az/: \u5728\u7ebf\u8bfe\u7a0b</li> <li>contrary to /\u02c8k\u0252ntr\u0259ri tu\u02d0/: \u4e0e\u2026\u2026\u76f8\u53cd</li> <li>strength to strength /str\u025b\u014b\u03b8 tu\u02d0 str\u025b\u014b\u03b8/: \u65e5\u76ca\u5f3a\u5927</li> <li>pay for knowledge /pe\u026a f\u0254\u02d0r \u02c8n\u0252l\u026ad\u0292/: \u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ed8\u8d39</li> <li>loyal /\u02c8l\u0254\u026a\u0259l/: \u5fe0\u8bda\u7684</li> <li>consuming /k\u0259n\u02c8sju\u02d0m\u026a\u014b/: \u6d88\u8d39</li> <li>right away /ra\u026at \u0259\u02c8we\u026a/: \u7acb\u5373</li> <li>make a name for oneself /me\u026ak \u0259 ne\u026am f\u0254\u02d0r w\u028cn\u02c8s\u025blf/: \u6210\u540d</li> <li>high-quality /ha\u026a-\u02c8kw\u0252l\u026ati/: \u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684</li> <li>mini lecture /\u02c8m\u026an\u026a \u02c8l\u025bkt\u0283\u0259r/: \u5c0f\u578b\u8bb2\u5ea7</li> <li>keen insight /ki\u02d0n \u02c8\u026ansa\u026at/: \u654f\u9510\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b</li> <li>rising middle class /\u02c8ra\u026az\u026a\u014b \u02c8m\u026adl kl\u0251\u02d0s/: \u5d1b\u8d77\u7684\u4e2d\u4ea7\u9636\u7ea7</li> <li>increase their wealth /\u026an\u02c8kri\u02d0s \u00f0\u025b\u0259r w\u025bl\u03b8/: \u589e\u52a0\u8d22\u5bcc</li> <li>improve the quality of their lives /\u026am\u02c8pru\u02d0v \u00f0\u0259 \u02c8kw\u0252l\u026ati \u0259v \u00f0\u025b\u0259r la\u026avz/: \u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf</li> <li>role model /r\u0259\u028al \u02c8m\u0252dl/: \u699c\u6837</li> <li>business acumen /\u02c8b\u026azn\u0259s \u02c8\u00e6kj\u028am\u0259n/: \u5546\u4e1a\u654f\u9510\u5ea6</li> <li>charisma /k\u0259\u02c8r\u026azm\u0259/: \u9b45\u529b</li> <li>admire /\u0259d\u02c8ma\u026a\u0259r/: \u94a6\u4f69</li> <li>persistence /p\u0259\u02c8s\u026ast\u0259ns/: \u575a\u6301</li> <li>courage /\u02c8k\u028cr\u026ad\u0292/: \u52c7\u6c14</li> <li>challenge the status quo /\u02c8\u02a7\u00e6l\u026an\u02a4 \u00f0\u0259 \u02c8ste\u026at\u0259s kwo\u028a/: \u6311\u6218\u73b0\u72b6</li> <li>start a course /st\u0251\u02d0rt \u0259 k\u0254\u02d0rs/: \u5f00\u8bbe\u8bfe\u7a0b</li> <li>lecturer /\u02c8l\u025bkt\u0283\u0259r\u0259r/: \u8bb2\u5e08</li> </ul> <p>Note: Practicing this response and familiarizing yourself with the advanced vocabulary will help enhance your fluency and coherence during the IELTS Speaking test.</p>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_13/#ielts-speaking-preparation-part-3-choosing-work","title":"IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Choosing Work","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_13/#1-what-kinds-of-jobs-do-young-people-not-want-to-do-in-your-country","title":"1.

You should say:</p> <ul> <li>what device you started using</li> <li>why you started using this device</li> <li>how easy or difficult it was to use</li> <li>and explain how helpful this device was to you.</li> </ul> <p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>I'm not really obsessed with electronics, so I'm not always upgrading my phone to the latest model or trying out new gadgets. However, I\u2019d like to talk about the time when I first switched from a PC to a Mac last year.</p> <p>What device you started using:</p> <p>Last year, I transitioned from using a PC to a MacBook, which is one of Apple\u2019s latest models.</p> <p>Why you started using this device:</p> <p>The primary reason for this switch was necessity. My old laptop had crashed for the third time, leaving me without a reliable device. Additionally, a friend convinced me to try the latest MacBook, highlighting Apple\u2019s renowned brilliant product design and seamless integration with other Apple products.</p> <p>How easy or difficult it was to use:</p> <p>Initially, the switch was somewhat challenging. Although Apple has a reputation for intuitive design, the operating system on the MacBook is vastly different from Windows. It took me about a month to fully adapt. For instance, I struggled with how iTunes works, particularly the concept of synchronization, which was new to me after years of simply copying and pasting files.</p> <p>Despite these challenges, I wouldn\u2019t say the MacBook is not user-friendly. On the contrary, once I got the hang of it, the interface became very intuitive, and I felt right at home. The surface was cool to the touch and slightly rounded, giving it an organic feel. The keyboard was smooth and crisp, living up to its much-coveted reputation. The elegant design and seamless functionality made the transition worthwhile.</p> <p>How helpful this device was to you:</p> <p>The MacBook has been incredibly helpful, especially since I also use an iPhone and an iPad.

Nowadays, children are already familiar with smartphones and tablet computers from a very young age, often even as toddlers.

While it's true that some of a teacher's responsibilities, such as delivering lectures or presentations, might be taken over by computers, teaching is inherently a two-way interaction that goes beyond mere information delivery. For example, teachers provide timely and constructive feedback and foster social interactions and human relationships that are crucial for students' overall development. Additionally, teaching involves understanding and responding to students' emotional and educational needs, something that computers are not capable of doing effectively. Face-to-face communication is essential for building trust and motivation among students, which cannot be replicated by technology.

On the other hand, Lan and I were of the opinion that we should tread carefully with AI, considering the possibility that one day we may reach the technological singularity\u2014which is known as the turning point when the intelligence of computers begins to surpass the collective intelligence of human beings.</p> <p>The discussion was riveting because we covered a number of interesting issues relating to AI, from its history to its recent developments, and even to the possible future depicted in the famous \"Matrix\" trilogies. Different ideas were exchanged, and we kept challenging each other to come up with more powerful arguments. It was truly an awesome discussion because apparently both sides had done their research to support their opinions. If there had been a neutral bystander, he or she would have had a hard time deciding who should have won.</p> <p>This heated discussion also gave us an idea of how exactly we should deliver the presentation in the form of a debate!

When you encounter a problem, it's understandable that you want to share it with those who are close to you. However, it's not wise to trouble too many people with it.

It's much better to focus on solving the problem rather than complaining about it.</p> <p>Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:</p> <ul> <li>encounter a problem /\u026an\u02c8ka\u028ant\u0259r \u0259 \u02c8pr\u0252bl\u0259m/: \u9047\u5230\u95ee\u9898</li> <li>strike people as /stra\u026ak \u02c8pi\u02d0pl \u00e6z/: \u8ba9\u67d0\u4eba\u89c9\u5f97</li> <li>self-absorbed /\u02ccs\u025blf-\u0259b\u02c8z\u0254\u02d0rbd/: \u81ea\u604b\u7684</li> <li>whiny /\u02c8wa\u026ani/: \u7231\u53d1\u7262\u9a9a\u7684</li> <li>go away /\u0261o\u028a \u0259\u02c8we\u026a/: \u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898</li> <li>trouble too many people /\u02c8tr\u028cb\u0259l tu\u02d0 \u02c8m\u025bni \u02c8pi\u02d0pl/: \u7ed9\u2026\u2026\u5e26\u6765\u9ebb\u70e6</li> <li>solving the problem /\u02c8s\u0252lv\u026a\u014b \u00f0\u0259 \u02c8pr\u0252bl\u0259m/: \u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898</li> <li>complaining /k\u0259m\u02c8ple\u026an\u026a\u014b/: \u62b1\u6028</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_13/#advanced-vocabulary-and-phrases-summary","title":"Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases Summary","text":"<ul> <li>two heads are better than one: \u6709\u5229\u6709\u5f0a\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\uff0c\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5408\u4f5c\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002</li> <li>new perspectives: \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002</li> <li>fresh eye: \u4ee5\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u770b\u5f85\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee5\u524d\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002</li> <li>in-depth discussion: \u6df1\u5165\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63a2\u8ba8\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5404\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u3002</li> <li>spark some new ideas: \u6fc0\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u3002</li> <li>stuck with a problem: \u88ab\u95ee\u9898\u56f0\u4f4f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u89e3\u51b3\u529e\u6cd5\u3002</li> <li>good idea: \u597d\u4e3b\u610f\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002</li> <li>moral support: \u7cbe\u795e\u4e0a\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7f13\u89e3\u60c5\u7eea\u538b\u529b\u3002</li> <li>consult them with: \u5f81\u6c42\u5efa\u8bae\u6216\u610f\u89c1\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002</li> <li>seek the advice of: \u5bfb\u6c42\u67d0\u4eba\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u4e13\u4e1a\u6216\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u610f\u89c1\u3002</li> <li>encounter a problem: \u9047\u5230\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9762\u5bf9\u6311\u6218\u3002</li> <li>strike people as: \u8ba9\u4eba\u89c9\u5f97\u67d0\u4eba\u5177\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u7279\u8d28\u3002</li> <li>self-absorbed: \u81ea\u604b\u7684\uff0c\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u81ea\u5df1\u3002</li> <li>whiny: \u7231\u53d1\u7262\u9a9a\u7684\uff0c\u5e38\u62b1\u6028\u7684\u3002</li> <li>go away: \u8ba9\u95ee\u9898\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002</li> <li>trouble too many people: \u7ed9\u8fc7\u591a\u4eba\u5e26\u6765\u9ebb\u70e6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4eba\u9645\u5173\u7cfb\u7d27\u5f20\u3002</li> <li>solving the problem: \u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002</li> <li>complaining: \u62b1\u6028\uff0c\u4e0d\u65ad\u8bc9\u82e6\u3002</li> </ul> <p>Note: Practicing these responses and understanding the advanced vocabulary will help enhance your fluency and coherence during the IELTS Speaking test.</p>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_13/#ielts-speaking-preparation-part-3-communication-skills-at-work","title":"IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Communication Skills at Work","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_13/#1-which-communication-skills-are-most-important-when-taking-part-in-meetings-with-colleagues","title":"1.

When confronted with too many alternatives, individuals may experience anxiety over making an incorrect selection.

While some assert that advertising is highly effective in persuading individuals to purchase products, others contend that its omnipresence has rendered it largely ineffective.</p> <p>Proponents of advertising\u2019s persuasive power emphasize how strategic campaigns can significantly elevate sales and enhance brand recognition. For example, meticulously crafted advertisements for new smartphone models can generate excitement and drive consumer interest, resulting in increased sales figures. Additionally, advertisements frequently tap into emotions and desires, rendering products appear indispensable. Celebrity endorsements and visually appealing imagery further amplify the persuasive effect, encouraging consumers to favor one brand over another.</p> <p>Conversely, the saturation of advertising in daily life has led to consumer desensitization. With advertisements ubiquitous across all platforms\u2014television, social media, billboards\u2014individuals have become adept at disregarding them. For instance, the prevalence of ad blockers and the tendency to skip commercials illustrate a growing inclination to avoid advertising content. Moreover, the repetitive nature of ads can induce annoyance, diminishing their efficacy and even fostering negative perceptions of brands. Consequently, some argue that the sheer volume of advertising has attenuated its capacity to influence purchasing decisions.</p> <p>In my view, while advertising remains a formidable tool for shaping consumer behavior, its effectiveness is waning due to overexposure and consumer fatigue.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of giving children this message? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.</p> <p>Essay:</p> <p>Encouraging children with the message that they can achieve anything through sufficient effort is a prevalent practice in numerous cultures. While this affirmation can inspire and motivate, it also presents potential drawbacks that warrant consideration.</p> <p>One notable advantage of this message is that it fosters a strong work ethic and resilience in children. Believing that hard work can overcome obstacles encourages persistence and dedication, which are essential traits for personal and professional success. For instance, a child who is assured that academic excellence is attainable through diligent study is more likely to develop effective study habits and a commitment to learning. Additionally, this positive reinforcement can enhance self-esteem and confidence, enabling children to embrace challenges and pursue their goals with determination.</p> <p>However, there are also disadvantages to this approach. Telling children they can achieve anything may set unrealistic expectations, leading to disappointment and frustration when they encounter failures. For example, a child who is consistently told they can become a professional athlete might experience significant stress and anxiety if they lack the necessary talent or suffer injuries. Furthermore, this message can overlook the importance of external factors such as socio-economic status, access to resources, and inherent abilities, which are crucial in achieving success. Consequently, children might develop a skewed perception of reality, believing that effort alone is sufficient to overcome all barriers.</p> <p>In my opinion, while encouraging children to strive for their goals is beneficial, it is equally important to educate them about the complexities and challenges they may face.

This company, a combination of therapy and diagnosis, was founded by a brilliant young Stanford dropout, Elizabeth Holmes, who promised to revolutionize the medical industry with a machine that would take a small sample of a customer's blood and test for an overall picture of their health. For a while, she was seen as the female Steve Jobs, and her company was valued at up to $9 billion. But the only problem was, the technology never actually worked.</p> <p>Now, unlike any other scam artist who would probably prey on gullible people at the bottom of the \u201cfood chain,\u201d Elizabeth went straight for the people at the top. Experienced politicians, Wall Street tycoons, and even military personnel\u2014all fell victim to her charm. The endorsement of these important people had, in turn, consolidated her status and credibility, which sustained the big lie until the very last minute.</p> <p>This is the part that got me thinking the most. Although it remains a mystery what Elizabeth said to her investors behind closed doors because she refused to be interviewed by the author, a lesson can be learned: anyone, regardless of status and experience, can be fooled when their ego and greed are appealed to.</p> <p>This book was such a page turner that I found myself unable to put it down once I started.

But there's much more. By consistently reading to your child every day, your child will learn to concentrate and sit still for longer periods of time, which can help them when they go to school. Another great benefit is reading develops children's imagination and creativity. When we really engage in a book, we imagine what the characters are doing and we visualize places we've never been to in real life. These are what make reading stimulating and fun. With all of the negative effects of screen time, choosing a book that interests your child and reading it together is definitely a better option.

I think it's fair to say that we now have an enormous variety of content accessible at any time of day, in any format, and through a range of digital devices. However, I reckon the majority of readers still prefer print books to digital products. I know many people who would sample a few pages online before buying a print version to read. But, of course, it all depends on the person. Some people enjoy the feel of a physical book in their hands, while others appreciate the handiness of an e-reader.

Printed books are tough and hard to destroy, compared to a digital disk, and they don't need any energy to operate. I think I'm quite convinced that there will always be a place for them.

However, I'd like to talk about a robot vacuum I bought that made my whole family very happy.</p> <p>First, I'll tell you how it looks and how it works. Like most robot vacuums, it's round and flat, resembling a thick disk with motorized brushes at the bottom and a vacuum motor to collect dust and rubbish. It also has sensors for evading obstacles and avoiding falls. On top of that, it can automatically return to its docking station to recharge when its battery is low. It's fascinating to watch how it works diligently around the house. I still remember how my parents were wide-eyed in amazement when I first showed them the magic.</p> <p>Ever since robot vacuums became popular, there have been a host of models and brands with all kinds of fancy features. Although the one I bought doesn't have all the bells and whistles of its competition, it's no hassle to install. What I love most is that it has a lower profile, allowing it to fit under more furniture. No more bending over to clean under the couch!</p> <p>Another thing I like about this robot is that it is much quieter than a regular vacuum cleaner. After I preset the vacuuming time, I can just sit back and enjoy a clean room. I wouldn't say this vacuum has delivered us from chores altogether, since no robot vacuum is quite as powerful as a traditional vacuum and some elbow grease.

But I guess we are all prone to buying more things than we need in this age of advertising and social media. Every advertisement carries the same message: your life will be better if you buy what they are selling. We begin to hear this message so many times and from so many angles that we start to subtly believe it. Meanwhile, social media further encourages comparison, and we usually end up buying stuff we don't need just because people in our friendship circles have done the same.

Why or why not?","text":"<p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>Well, in terms of architecture and layout, I'm not sure if there will be any drastic changes in how homes look in the next few decades. After all, the most cutting-edge homes today still have many of the same features that homes had fifty years ago. We still have kitchens, living rooms, bedrooms, and bathrooms. We're still sitting on sofas, eating at tables, and sleeping on mattresses on bed frames. However, if I have to predict what is going to change, it seems a given that most of our electronics and appliances will only get better, and they are bound to change how we live our lives at home. For example, a smart home with all the appliances wirelessly connected and controlled by a single device is no longer science fiction.

However, this brings some problems. Sometimes, it's really hard for me to resist the temptation of scrolling through the items because almost every single item is something I like. During this process, time just slips away, and it becomes a big waste of time.

Compared to shopping on the internet, physical stores offer people opportunities to socialize. They can share moments with friends and family during shopping or even interact with strangers, like the shopping assistants. This kind of face-to-face communication is much more effective than online interaction. Moreover, most shopping malls are not just places for shopping; they are also pleasant areas for having meals or engaging in recreational activities.

This essay will examine both viewpoints before offering my own perspective.</p> <p>Advocates of the view that species loss is the foremost environmental problem emphasize that biodiversity is essential for ecosystem stability and overall planetary health. For example, the extinction of pollinators like bees can disrupt food production and agricultural economies, leading to broader economic and ecological repercussions. Furthermore, each species plays a unique role within its habitat, contributing to vital natural processes such as decomposition and nutrient cycling. Therefore, preserving species diversity is deemed crucial for maintaining ecological balance and ensuring the resilience of ecosystems against environmental changes.</p> <p>Conversely, some argue that other environmental problems, such as climate change and pollution, are more pressing due to their widespread and immediate impacts on both natural and human systems. They contend that rising global temperatures can trigger extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and habitat loss, affecting millions of lives and destabilizing economies. Additionally, pollution of air and water sources poses significant health risks to humans and wildlife alike, undermining the very foundations of healthy ecosystems. Proponents of this perspective believe that addressing these broader issues will inherently benefit biodiversity and species preservation, making them more urgent priorities.</p> <p>In my opinion, while the loss of species is undeniably a critical concern, it is intrinsically linked to larger environmental challenges like climate change and pollution.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?</p> <p>Essay:</p> <p>Music is often hailed as a universal language that can bridge cultural and generational divides. I strongly agree with the opinion that music serves as an effective medium for uniting people of different cultures and ages, fostering mutual understanding and harmony.</p> <p>Firstly, music transcends language barriers, enabling individuals from diverse backgrounds to connect on an emotional level. For example, a lively samba rhythm can unite people from various countries, allowing them to enjoy the same melody regardless of their native language. Additionally, music events such as concerts and festivals create environments where people of all ages can come together, share experiences, and build lasting memories. This shared enjoyment fosters a sense of community and belonging among participants, breaking down social and cultural barriers.</p> <p>However, it is important to acknowledge that music alone may not entirely eliminate cultural and generational differences. While music can initiate interactions, deeper understanding requires more comprehensive efforts, including education and open dialogue. For instance, differing musical tastes and preferences can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or a lack of appreciation for each other's styles. Moreover, generational gaps in music preferences can create barriers in communication and mutual enjoyment. Therefore, while music is a powerful tool for connection, it should be complemented with other initiatives to fully bridge cultural and age-related divides.</p> <p>In conclusion, music plays a significant role in uniting people from various cultures and age groups, but it should be part of a broader strategy to achieve complete social integration.</p> <p>\u6ce8\u91ca\uff1a</p> <ul> <li>universal language /\u02ccju\u02d0n\u026a\u02c8v\u025c\u02d0rs\u0259l \u02c8l\u00e6\u014b\u0261w\u026ad\u0292/: \u901a\u7528\u8bed\u8a00</li> <li>bridge cultural and generational divides /br\u026ad\u0292 \u02c8k\u028clt\u0283\u0259r\u0259l \u00e6nd \u02ccd\u0292\u025bn\u0259\u02c8re\u026a\u0283\u0259n\u0259l d\u026a\u02c8va\u026adz/: \u67b6\u8d77\u6587\u5316\u548c\u4ee3\u9645\u7684\u6865\u6881</li> <li>mutual understanding /\u02c8mju\u02d0tj\u028a\u0259l \u02cc\u028cnd\u0259r\u02c8st\u00e6nd\u026a\u014b/: \u76f8\u4e92\u7406\u89e3</li> <li>harmony /\u02c8h\u0251\u02d0m\u0259ni/: \u548c\u8c10</li> <li>transcends language barriers /tr\u00e6n\u02c8s\u025bndz \u02c8l\u00e6\u014b\u0261w\u026ad\u0292 \u02c8b\u00e6ri\u0259z/: \u8d85\u8d8a\u8bed\u8a00\u969c\u788d</li> <li>connect on an emotional level /k\u0259\u02c8n\u025bkt \u0252n \u0259n \u026a\u02c8m\u0259\u028a\u0283\u0259n\u0259l \u02c8l\u025bv\u0259l/: \u5728\u60c5\u611f\u5c42\u9762\u4e0a\u8fde\u63a5</li> <li>samba rhythm /\u02c8s\u00e6mb\u0259 \u02c8r\u026a\u00f0\u0259m/: \u6851\u5df4\u8282\u594f</li> <li>music events /\u02c8mju\u02d0z\u026ak \u026a\u02c8v\u025bnts/: \u97f3\u4e50\u6d3b\u52a8</li> <li>fostering a sense of community /\u02c8f\u0252st\u0259r\u026a\u014b \u0259 s\u025bns \u0259v k\u0259\u02c8mju\u02d0n\u026ati/: \u57f9\u517b\u793e\u533a\u611f</li> <li>belonging among participants /b\u026a\u02c8l\u0252\u014b\u026a\u014b \u0259\u02c8m\u028c\u014b p\u0251\u02d0\u02c8t\u026as\u026ap\u0259nts/: \u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f52\u5c5e\u611f</li> <li>cultural and generational differences /\u02c8k\u028clt\u0283\u0259r\u0259l \u00e6nd \u02ccd\u0292\u025bn\u0259\u02c8re\u026a\u0283\u0259n\u0259l \u02c8d\u026af(\u0259)r(\u0259)nsiz/: \u6587\u5316\u548c\u4ee3\u9645\u5dee\u5f02</li> <li>comprehensive efforts /\u02cck\u0252mpr\u026a\u02c8h\u025bns\u026av \u02c8\u025bf\u0259rts/: \u5168\u9762\u7684\u52aa\u529b</li> <li>musical tastes and preferences /\u02c8mju\u02d0z\u026ak\u0259l te\u026asts \u00e6nd \u02ccpr\u025bf(\u0259)\u02c8r\u025bnsiz/: \u97f3\u4e50\u54c1\u5473\u548c\u504f\u597d</li> <li>social integration /\u02c8s\u0259\u028a\u0283\u0259l \u02cc\u026ant\u026a\u02c8\u0261re\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u793e\u4f1a\u878d\u5408</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_14/#essay-4","title":"Essay 4","text":"<p>Question:</p> <p>Nowadays many people choose to be self-employed, rather than to work for a company or organisation. Why might this be the case? What could be the disadvantages of being self-employed?</p> <p>Essay:</p> <p>In today\u2019s society, an increasing number of individuals are opting to become self-employed instead of working for established companies or organizations. This shift can be attributed to several factors, but it also comes with its own set of challenges.</p> <p>One primary reason for the rise in self-employment is the desire for greater flexibility and autonomy. Many people seek the ability to set their own schedules and make independent decisions about their work. For example, freelancers in the gig economy enjoy the freedom to choose projects that align with their interests and skills, allowing for a more personalized career path. Additionally, advancements in technology have made it easier to start and manage a business from virtually anywhere, reducing the barriers to entry for aspiring entrepreneurs. This technological empowerment enables individuals to operate efficiently without the need for significant initial investments or infrastructure.</p> <p>However, self-employment also presents significant disadvantages that can impact individuals negatively. One major drawback is the lack of job security and stable income. Unlike salaried positions, self-employed individuals often face inconsistent earnings and financial uncertainty, which can lead to stress and anxiety. For instance, freelance graphic designers may experience periods of high demand followed by times with few projects, making it difficult to plan financially. Furthermore, self-employed individuals are responsible for all aspects of their business, including marketing, administration, and financial management, which can be overwhelming and detract from their core professional activities. This multifaceted responsibility can lead to burnout and reduce the quality of their primary work.</p> <p>In conclusion, while self-employment offers flexibility and independence, it also entails financial instability and increased personal responsibility, making it essential for individuals to weigh the pros and cons carefully before making the transition.</p> <p>\u6ce8\u91ca\uff1a</p> <ul> <li>self-employed /\u02ccs\u025blf-\u026am\u02c8pl\u0254\u026ad/: \u81ea\u96c7\u7684</li> <li>established companies /\u026a\u02c8st\u00e6bl\u026a\u0283t \u02c8k\u028cmp\u0259niz/: \u5df2\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u516c\u53f8</li> <li>flexibility and autonomy /fl\u025bks\u026a\u02c8b\u026al\u0259ti \u00e6nd \u0254\u02d0\u02c8t\u0252n\u0259mi/: \u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6743</li> <li>freelancers /\u02c8fri\u02d0l\u0259ns\u0259z/: \u81ea\u7531\u804c\u4e1a\u8005</li> <li>gig economy /\u0261\u026a\u0261 \u026a\u02c8k\u0252n\u0259mi/: \u96f6\u5de5\u7ecf\u6d4e</li> <li>personalized career path /\u02ccp\u025c\u02d0s\u0259n\u0259la\u026azd k\u0259\u02c8r\u026a\u0259r p\u0251\u02d0\u03b8/: \u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u8def\u5f84</li> <li>barriers to entry /\u02c8b\u00e6r\u026a\u0259z t\u0259 \u02c8\u025bnt\u0259ri/: \u8fdb\u5165\u58c1\u5792</li> <li>aspiring entrepreneurs /\u0259\u02c8spa\u026a\u0259r\u026a\u014b \u02cc\u0252ntr\u0259pr\u0259\u02c8n\u025c\u02d0rz/: \u6709\u62b1\u8d1f\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bb6</li> <li>job security /d\u0292\u0252b s\u026a\u02c8kj\u028a\u0259r\u026ati/: \u5de5\u4f5c\u4fdd\u969c</li> <li>stable income /\u02c8ste\u026abl \u02c8\u026ank\u028cm/: \u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u5165</li> <li>inconsistent earnings /\u02cc\u026ank\u0259n\u02c8s\u026ast\u0259nt \u02c8\u025c\u02d0n\u026a\u014bz/: \u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6536\u5165</li> <li>financial uncertainty /fa\u026a\u02c8n\u00e6n\u0283\u0259l \u028cn\u02c8s\u025c\u02d0t\u026anti/: \u8d22\u52a1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027</li> <li>freelance graphic designers /\u02c8fri\u02d0l\u0259ns \u02c8\u0261r\u00e6f\u026ak d\u026a\u02c8za\u026an\u0259z/: \u81ea\u7531\u804c\u4e1a\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08</li> <li>financial management /fa\u026a\u02c8n\u00e6n\u0283\u0259l \u02c8m\u00e6n\u026ad\u0292m\u0259nt/: \u8d22\u52a1\u7ba1\u7406</li> <li>core professional activities /k\u0254\u02d0 \u02ccpr\u0259\u02c8f\u025b\u0283\u0259nl \u00e6k\u02c8t\u026av\u026atiz/: \u6838\u5fc3\u804c\u4e1a\u6d3b\u52a8</li> <li>transition /tr\u00e6n\u02c8z\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u8f6c\u53d8</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_15/","title":"Cambridge English IELTS 15","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_15/#speaking","title":"Speaking","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_15/#writing","title":"writing","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_15/#essay-1","title":"Essay 1","text":"<p>Question</p> <p>In some countries, owning a home rather than renting one is very important for people. Why might this be the case? Do you think this is a positive or negative situation? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.</p> <p>Essay:</p> <p>Owning a home is often regarded as a significant milestone in many countries, embodying profound cultural and economic significance. This emphasis on homeownership stems from the belief that it provides stability and security as well as investment opportunities, while others contend that it may impose financial burdens and limit mobility.</p> <p>One primary reason people prioritize homeownership is the sense of stability and security it offers. Homeowners enjoy a permanent residence, free from the uncertainties associated with rental agreements and the looming threat of eviction. For instance, owning a house enables families to establish deep roots within a community, fostering robust social connections and support networks. Additionally, property ownership is perceived as a long-term investment that can appreciate over time, contributing to wealth accumulation and financial prosperity.</p> <p>However, homeownership carries both advantages and disadvantages for individuals and society. On the positive side, it enhances personal satisfaction and pride, contributing to overall well-being and a sense of achievement. Conversely, the financial obligations of mortgage payments, maintenance costs, and property taxes can be substantial, particularly in high-cost regions.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.</p> <p>Essay:</p> <p>The rapid advancement of digital technology has revolutionized the way we consume information, leading some to predict that printed newspapers and books will become obsolete. I partially agree with this statement, as while digital reading is poised to dominate, there will still be a sustained demand for printed materials.</p> <p>One significant advantage of online reading is its accessibility and convenience. Digital platforms enable users to access a vast repository of information instantly from anywhere, often at a lower cost or even for free. For example, e-books can be downloaded to various devices, eliminating the need for physical storage and allowing readers to carry multiple books simultaneously. Additionally, online newspapers offer real-time updates, providing the latest news without the delay inherent in print editions. These benefits make digital reading an appealing option for many, contributing to the decline of printed materials.</p> <p>However, printed newspapers and books retain their relevance for several reasons. Many individuals appreciate the tactile experience of reading on paper, finding it more enjoyable and less straining on the eyes compared to screens. Moreover, printed materials do not rely on electronic devices or internet connectivity, making them accessible in environments where digital access is limited. For instance, books are often valued as collectibles and are passed down through generations, preserving cultural heritage. Furthermore, certain academic and professional fields continue to depend heavily on printed resources for their credibility and permanence.</p> <p>In conclusion, while digital reading is likely to increasingly overshadow printed newspapers and books due to its convenience and accessibility, there will remain a niche market for printed materials driven by personal preferences and specific requirements.</p> <p>\u6ce8\u91ca\uff1a</p> <ul> <li>digital technology /\u02c8d\u026ad\u0292\u026atl t\u025bk\u02c8n\u0252l\u0259d\u0292i/: \u6570\u5b57\u6280\u672f</li> <li>consume information /k\u0259n\u02c8sju\u02d0m \u02cc\u026anf\u0259\u02c8me\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u6d88\u8d39\u4fe1\u606f</li> <li>obsolete /\u02cc\u0252bs\u0259li\u02c8\u025bs\u0259nt/: \u8fc7\u65f6\u7684</li> <li>accessibility and convenience /\u0259k\u02ccs\u025bs\u026a\u02c8b\u026al\u0259ti \u00e6nd k\u0259n\u02c8vi\u02d0ni\u0259ns/: \u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u548c\u4fbf\u5229\u6027</li> <li>digital platforms /\u02c8d\u026ad\u0292\u026atl \u02c8pl\u00e6tf\u0254\u02d0mz/: \u6570\u5b57\u5e73\u53f0</li> <li>e-books /i\u02d0-b\u028aks/: \u7535\u5b50\u4e66</li> <li>physical storage /\u02c8f\u026az\u026akl \u02c8st\u0254\u02d0r\u026ad\u0292/: \u7269\u7406\u5b58\u50a8</li> <li>real-time updates /\u02ccr\u026a\u0259l ta\u026am \u02c8\u028cpde\u026ats/: \u5b9e\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0</li> <li>tactile experience /\u02c8t\u00e6kt\u028c\u026al \u026ak\u02c8sp\u026a\u0259r\u026a\u0259ns/: \u89e6\u89c9\u4f53\u9a8c</li> <li>credibility and permanence /kr\u026a\u02c8d\u026ab\u026al\u0259ti \u00e6nd \u02c8p\u025c\u02d0m\u0259n\u0259ns/: \u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u6c38\u4e45\u6027</li> <li>niche market /ni\u02d0\u0283 \u02c8m\u0251\u02d0k\u026at/: \u5229\u57fa\u5e02\u573a</li> <li>personal preferences /\u02c8p\u025c\u02d0s\u0259nl \u02ccpr\u025bf(\u0259)\u02c8r\u025bnsiz/: \u4e2a\u4eba\u504f\u597d</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_15/#essay-3","title":"Essay 3","text":"<p>Question</p> <p>Some people say that advertising is extremely successful at persuading us to buy things.

While some assert that advertising is highly effective in persuading consumers to purchase products, others argue that its ubiquity has rendered it ineffective.</p> <p>Proponents of advertising\u2019s persuasive power emphasize how strategically designed campaigns can substantially boost sales and brand recognition. For example, meticulously crafted advertisements for new smartphone models can generate excitement and drive consumer interest, leading to increased sales figures. Furthermore, advertisements often tap into emotions and aspirations, making products appear essential.

With advertisements omnipresent across various platforms\u2014television, social media, billboards\u2014individuals have become adept at ignoring them. The prevalence of ad blockers and the habitual skipping of commercials exemplify a growing trend of advertisement avoidance. Additionally, the repetitive nature of ads can incite irritation, diminishing their effectiveness and even fostering negative brand perceptions. Consequently, some believe that the sheer volume of advertising has undermined its ability to influence purchasing decisions.</p> <p>In my opinion, while advertising remains a potent tool for shaping consumer behavior, its efficacy is diminishing due to overexposure and consumer fatigue.</p> <p>\u6ce8\u91ca\uff1a</p> <ul> <li>crucial role /\u02c8kru\u02d0\u0283\u0259l r\u0259\u028al/: \u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528</li> <li>consumer behavior /k\u0259n\u02c8sju\u02d0m\u0259r b\u026a\u02c8he\u026avj\u0259r/: \u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u884c\u4e3a</li> <li>market dynamics /\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0k\u026at da\u026a\u02c8n\u00e6m\u026aks/: \u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001</li> <li>ubiquity /ju\u02d0\u02c8b\u026akw\u026ati/: \u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728</li> <li>strategically designed campaigns /str\u0259\u02c8ti\u02d0d\u0292\u026akli d\u026a\u02c8za\u026and k\u00e6m\u02c8pe\u026anz/: \u6218\u7565\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8</li> <li>brand recognition /br\u00e6nd \u02ccr\u025bk\u0259\u0261\u02c8n\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u54c1\u724c\u8ba4\u77e5</li> <li>consumer interest /k\u0259n\u02c8sju\u02d0m\u0259r \u02c8\u026antr\u0259st/: \u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5174\u8da3</li> <li>emotions and aspirations /\u026a\u02c8m\u0259\u028a\u0283\u0259nz \u00e6nd \u02cc\u00e6sp\u026a\u02c8re\u026a\u0283\u0259nz/: \u60c5\u611f\u548c\u62b1\u8d1f</li> <li>essential /\u026a\u02c8s\u025bn\u0283\u0259l/: \u5fc5\u8981\u7684</li> <li>celebrity endorsements /s\u025bl\u026a\u02c8br\u026ati \u02cc\u025bnd\u0259\u02c8sm\u025bnts/: \u540d\u4eba\u4ee3\u8a00</li> <li>consumer desensitization /k\u0259n\u02c8sju\u02d0m\u0259r \u02ccd\u025bs\u0259n\u02ccs\u026at\u026a\u02c8ze\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u8131\u654f</li> <li>ad blockers /\u00e6d \u02c8bl\u0252k\u0259z/: \u5e7f\u544a\u62e6\u622a\u5668</li> <li>advertisement avoidance /\u02cc\u00e6dv\u0259ta\u026az\u02c8m\u0259nt \u0259\u02c8v\u0254\u026ad\u0259ns/: \u907f\u514d\u5e7f\u544a</li> <li>repetitive nature /r\u026a\u02c8p\u025bt\u0259t\u026av \u02c8ne\u026at\u0283\u0259r/: \u91cd\u590d\u6027\u8d28</li> <li>negative brand perceptions /\u02c8n\u025b\u0261\u0259t\u026av br\u00e6nd p\u0259r\u02c8s\u025bp\u0283\u0259nz/: \u8d1f\u9762\u54c1\u724c\u8ba4\u77e5</li> <li>overexposure /\u02cco\u028av\u0259r\u026ak\u02c8sp\u0259\u028a\u0292\u0259r/: \u8fc7\u5ea6\u66dd\u5149</li> <li>consumer fatigue /k\u0259n\u02c8sju\u02d0m\u0259r f\u0259\u02c8ti\u02d0\u0261/: \u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u75b2\u52b3</li> <li>engaging and targeted campaigns /\u026an\u02c8\u0261e\u026ad\u0292\u026a\u014b \u00e6nd \u02c8t\u0251\u02d0\u0261\u0259t\u026ad k\u00e6m\u02c8pe\u026anz/: \u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8</li> <li>crowded marketplace /\u02c8kra\u028ad\u026ad \u02c8m\u0251\u02d0k\u026atple\u026as/: \u62e5\u6324\u7684\u5e02\u573a</li> <li>meticulously crafted /m\u0259\u02c8t\u026akj\u028al\u0259sli kr\u00e6ft/: \u7cbe\u5fc3\u5236\u4f5c\u7684</li> <li>boost sales /bu\u02d0st se\u026alz/: \u63d0\u9ad8\u9500\u552e</li> <li>drive consumer interest /dra\u026av k\u0259n\u02c8sju\u02d0m\u0259r \u02c8\u026antr\u0259st/: \u63a8\u52a8\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5174\u8da3</li> <li>generate excitement /\u02c8d\u0292\u025bn\u0259re\u026at \u026ak\u02c8sa\u026atm\u0259nt/: \u4ea7\u751f\u5174\u594b</li> <li>habitual skipping /h\u0259\u02c8b\u026atj\u028a\u0259l \u02c8sk\u026ap\u026a\u014b/: \u4e60\u60ef\u6027\u8df3\u8fc7</li> <li>diminishing effectiveness /d\u026a\u02c8m\u026an\u026a\u0283\u026a\u014b \u026a\u02c8f\u025bkt\u026avn\u0259s/: \u6548\u679c\u51cf\u5f31</li> <li>fostering negative brand perceptions /\u02c8f\u0252st\u0259r\u026a\u014b \u02c8n\u025b\u0261\u0259t\u026av br\u00e6nd p\u0259r\u02c8s\u025bp\u0283\u0259nz/: \u57f9\u517b\u8d1f\u9762\u54c1\u724c\u8ba4\u77e5</li> <li>persuading /p\u0259r\u02c8swe\u026ad\u026a\u014b/: \u8bf4\u670d</li> <li>omnipresent /\u0252m\u02c8n\u026apr\u026aznt/: \u65e0\u5904\u4e0d\u5728\u7684</li> <li>billboards /\u02c8b\u026alb\u0254\u02d0rdz/: \u5e7f\u544a\u724c</li> <li>substantially /s\u0259b\u02c8st\u00e6n\u0283\u0259li/: \u5927\u91cf\u5730\uff0c\u5b9e\u8d28\u4e0a</li> <li>repetitive /r\u026a\u02c8p\u025bt\u0259t\u026av/: \u91cd\u590d\u7684</li> <li>desensitization /\u02ccd\u025bs\u0259n\u02ccs\u026at\u026a\u02c8ze\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u8131\u654f</li> <li>campaigns /k\u00e6m\u02c8pe\u026anz/: \u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd0\u52a8</li> <li>boost /bu\u02d0st/: \u63d0\u9ad8</li> <li>drive /dra\u026av/: \u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8</li> <li>generate /\u02c8d\u0292\u025bn\u0259re\u026at/: \u4ea7\u751f</li> <li>excitement /\u026ak\u02c8sa\u026atm\u0259nt/: \u5174\u594b</li> <li>habitual /h\u0259\u02c8b\u026atj\u028a\u0259l/: \u4e60\u60ef\u7684</li> <li>diminishing /d\u026a\u02c8m\u026an\u026a\u0283\u026a\u014b/: \u51cf\u5c11\u7684</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_15/#essay-4","title":"Essay 4","text":"<p>Question</p> <p>In some cultures, children are often told that they can achieve anything if they try hard enough. What are the advantages and disadvantages of giving children this message? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.</p> <p>Essay:</p> <p>Encouraging children by affirming that they can achieve anything through sufficient effort is a prevalent practice in many cultures. While this message can inspire and motivate, it also carries potential drawbacks that warrant careful consideration.</p> <p>One significant advantage of this message is that it cultivates a strong work ethic and resilience in children. Believing that hard work can overcome obstacles fosters persistence and dedication, which are essential traits for personal and professional success. For example, a child who is encouraged to excel academically through diligent study is more likely to develop effective study habits and a commitment to lifelong learning. Additionally, this positive reinforcement can enhance self-esteem and confidence, empowering children to embrace challenges and pursue their goals with determination.</p> <p>However, there are notable disadvantages to this approach. Telling children they can achieve anything may set unrealistic expectations, leading to disappointment and frustration when they encounter failures. For instance, a child consistently told they can become a professional athlete might experience significant stress and anxiety if they lack the necessary talent or suffer injuries. Furthermore, this message can overlook the importance of external factors such as socio-economic status, access to resources, and innate abilities, which play crucial roles in achieving success. Consequently, children might develop a distorted perception of reality, believing that effort alone is sufficient to overcome all barriers.</p> <p>In my opinion, while encouraging children to strive for their goals is beneficial, it is equally important to teach them about the complexities and challenges they may face.</p> <p>\u6ce8\u91ca\uff1a</p> <ul> <li>cultivates a strong work ethic /\u02c8k\u028clt\u026ave\u026ats \u0259 str\u0252\u014b w\u025c\u02d0k \u02c8\u025b\u03b8\u026ak/: \u57f9\u517b\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u9053\u5fb7</li> <li>resilience /r\u026a\u02c8z\u026ali\u0259ns/: \u97e7\u6027</li> <li>overcome obstacles /\u02cc\u0259\u028av\u0259r\u02c8k\u028cm \u02c8\u0252bst\u0259k\u0259lz/: \u514b\u670d\u969c\u788d</li> <li>persistence /p\u0259r\u02c8s\u026ast\u0259ns/: \u575a\u6301</li> <li>dedication /\u02ccd\u025bd\u026a\u02c8ke\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u5949\u732e</li> <li>personal and professional success /\u02c8p\u025c\u02d0s\u0259nl \u00e6nd pr\u0259\u02c8f\u025b\u0283\u0259nl s\u0259k\u02c8s\u025bs/: \u4e2a\u4eba\u548c\u804c\u4e1a\u6210\u529f</li> <li>commitment to lifelong learning /k\u0259\u02c8m\u026atm\u0259nt t\u0259 \u02c8la\u026afl\u0252\u014b \u02c8l\u025c\u02d0n\u026a\u014b/: \u5bf9\u7ec8\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u627f\u8bfa</li> <li>positive reinforcement /\u02c8p\u0252z\u0259t\u026av \u02ccri\u02d0\u026an\u02c8f\u0254\u02d0sm\u0259nt/: \u79ef\u6781\u7684\u5f3a\u5316</li> <li>self-esteem /s\u025blf \u026a\u02c8sti\u02d0m/: \u81ea\u5c0a</li> <li>unrealistic expectations /\u02cc\u028cnri\u02d0\u0259\u02c8l\u026ast\u026ak \u02cc\u025bksp\u025bk\u02c8te\u026a\u0283\u0259nz/: \u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u671f\u671b</li> <li>significant stress and anxiety /s\u026a\u02c8\u0261n\u026af\u026ak\u0259nt str\u025bs \u00e6nd \u00e6\u014b\u02c8za\u026a\u0259ti/: \u91cd\u5927\u7684\u538b\u529b\u548c\u7126\u8651</li> <li>external factors /\u026ak\u02c8st\u025c\u02d0n\u0259l \u02c8fakt\u0259z/: \u5916\u90e8\u56e0\u7d20</li> <li>socio-economic status /\u02ccs\u0259\u028as\u026a\u0259\u028a\u02cc\u025bk\u0259\u02c8n\u0252m\u026ak \u02c8ste\u026at\u0259s/: \u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u4f4d</li> <li>access to resources /\u02c8\u00e6ks\u025bs t\u0259 r\u026a\u02c8z\u0254\u02d0s\u026az/: \u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u83b7\u53d6</li> <li>innate abilities /\u026a\u02c8ne\u026at \u0259\u02c8b\u026al\u026atiz/: \u5929\u751f\u80fd\u529b</li> <li>distorted perception of reality /d\u026as\u02c8t\u0254\u02d0t\u026ad p\u0259r\u02c8s\u025bp\u0283\u0259n \u0259v ri\u02c8\u00e6l\u026ati/: \u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u626d\u66f2\u8ba4\u77e5</li> <li>overcome all barriers /\u02cc\u0259\u028av\u0259r\u02c8k\u028cm \u0254\u02d0l \u02c8b\u00e6r\u026a\u0259z/: \u514b\u670d\u6240\u6709\u969c\u788d</li> <li>Balancing motivation with realistic expectations /\u02c8b\u00e6l\u0259ns\u026a\u014b \u02ccm\u0259\u028at\u026a\u02c8ve\u026a\u0283\u0259n w\u026a\u00f0 \u02ccri\u02d0\u0259\u02c8l\u026ast\u026ak \u02cc\u025bksp\u025bk\u02c8te\u026a\u0283\u0259nz/: \u5728\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u671f\u671b\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861</li> <li>affirming /\u0259\u02c8f\u025c\u02d0m\u026a\u014b/: \u80af\u5b9a</li> <li>prevalent /\u02c8pr\u025bv\u0259l\u0259nt/: \u6d41\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u666e\u904d\u7684</li> <li>drawbacks /\u02c8dr\u0254\u02d0b\u00e6kz/: \u7f3a\u70b9</li> <li>warrant /\u02c8w\u0252r\u0259nt/: \u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u62c5\u4fdd</li> <li>diligent /\u02c8d\u026al\u026ad\u0292\u0259nt/: \u52e4\u594b\u7684</li> <li>empowering /\u026am\u02c8pa\u028a\u0259r\u026a\u014b/: \u8d4b\u4e88\u6743\u529b</li> <li>embrace /\u026am\u02c8bre\u026as/: \u62e5\u62b1\uff0c\u63a5\u53d7</li> <li>frustration /fr\u028c\u02ccstre\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u632b\u6298</li> <li>overlook /\u02cc\u0259\u028av\u0259r\u02c8l\u028ak/: \u5ffd\u89c6</li> <li>consequently /\u02c8k\u0252ns\u026akw\u0259ntli/: \u56e0\u6b64</li> <li>equally important /\u02c8i\u02d0kw\u0259li \u026am\u02c8p\u0254\u02d0t\u0259nt/: \u540c\u6837\u91cd\u8981</li> <li>complexities /\u02cck\u0252mpl\u026a\u02c8ks\u026atiz/: \u590d\u6742\u6027</li> <li>challenges /\u02c8t\u0283\u00e6l\u026and\u0292\u026az/: \u6311\u6218</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_9/","title":"Cambridge English IELTS 9","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_9/#speaking","title":"Speaking","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_9/#ielts-speaking-preparation-part-1-games","title":"IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 1 - Games","text":"<p>In the first part of the IELTS Speaking test, the examiner will introduce themselves and confirm your identity.

You should say:</p> <ul> <li>where the market is</li> <li>what the market sells</li> <li>how big the market is</li> <li>and explain why you enjoyed visiting this market.</li> </ul> <p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>I'd like to talk about a vibrant street market I visited in London that left a lasting impression on me. It's located just a two-minute bus ride from my hotel in the city center. The market is tucked away in a narrow alley, making it a hidden gem despite its central location. If you're looking for clothes or accessories, this market is definitely the place to be. However, be cautious with your wallet unless you're prepared to make some purchases, as the variety and quality of items can be quite tempting!</p> <p>The market is much larger than it appears from the outside. Once you step inside, you'll find a sprawling array of stalls specializing in everything you can think of\u2014from handmade jewelry and vintage clothing to unique home d\u00e9cor and artisanal snacks. The massive range of snack bars, cafes, and various shops ensures that visitors can spend hours exploring without getting bored.</p> <p>One of the main reasons I enjoyed visiting this market was the sheer diversity of products available. Whether you're a fashion enthusiast, a food lover, or someone looking for unique souvenirs, there's something for everyone. Additionally, the atmosphere is always lively and bustling, filled with the sounds of vendors calling out their goods and the aroma of freshly prepared street food.</p> <p>Another highlight of this market is the regular events they host, such as live music performances and cultural exhibitions, which add an extra layer of enjoyment to the shopping experience. Personally, I visited the market on a Wednesday when they were offering a 10% discount on selected items, which was a fantastic opportunity to snag some high-quality designer pieces at affordable prices. The friendly and approachable vendors also made the experience more pleasant, as they were always ready to help and engage in conversations.</p> <p>Overall, this street market is a shopper's paradise. Its strategic location, extensive variety of products, and vibrant atmosphere make it a must-visit destination for both locals and tourists alike.</p>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_9/#advanced-vocabulary-and-phrases","title":"Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases","text":"<ul> <li>vibrant street market /\u02c8va\u026abr\u0259nt stri\u02d0t \u02c8m\u0251\u02d0rk\u026at/: \u5145\u6ee1\u6d3b\u529b\u7684\u8857\u5e02</li> <li>lasting impression /\u02c8l\u00e6st\u026a\u014b \u026am\u02c8pr\u025b\u0283\u0259n/: \u6301\u4e45\u7684\u5370\u8c61</li> <li>hidden gem /\u02c8h\u026ad\u0259n d\u0292\u025bm/: \u9690\u85cf\u7684\u5b9d\u77f3</li> <li>make some purchases /me\u026ak s\u028cm \u02c8p\u025c\u02d0rt\u0283\u0259s\u026az/: \u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u4e9b\u8d2d\u4e70</li> <li>sprawling array /\u02c8spr\u0254\u02d0l\u026a\u014b \u0259\u02c8re\u026a/: \u5e7f\u9614\u7684\u6392\u5217</li> <li>artisan snacks /\u0251\u02d0r\u02c8t\u026az\u0259n sn\u00e6ks/: \u624b\u5de5\u5c0f\u5403</li> <li>unique souvenirs /ju\u02d0\u02c8ni\u02d0k \u02ccsu\u02d0v\u0259\u02c8n\u026a\u0259rz/: \u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7eaa\u5ff5\u54c1</li> <li>regular events /\u02c8r\u025bgj\u0259l\u0259r \u026a\u02c8v\u025bnts/: \u5b9a\u671f\u6d3b\u52a8</li> <li>live music performances /la\u026av \u02c8mju\u02d0z\u026ak p\u0259r\u02c8f\u0254\u02d0rm\u0259ns\u0259z/: \u73b0\u573a\u97f3\u4e50\u8868\u6f14</li> <li>cultural exhibitions /\u02c8k\u028clt\u0283\u0259r\u0259l \u02cc\u025bks\u026ab\u026a\u02c8\u0283\u0259nz/: \u6587\u5316\u5c55\u89c8</li> <li>10% discount /\u02c8t\u025bn p\u0259r\u02c8s\u025bnt d\u026as\u02c8ka\u028ant/: 10%\u6298\u6263</li> <li>designer pieces /d\u026a\u02c8za\u026an\u0259r \u02c8pi\u02d0s\u0259z/: \u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u4f5c\u54c1</li> <li>approachable vendors /\u0259\u02c8pro\u028at\u0283\u0259bl \u02c8v\u025bnd\u0259rz/: \u5e73\u6613\u8fd1\u4eba\u7684\u644a\u8d29</li> <li>shopper's paradise /\u02c8\u0283\u0252p\u0259rz \u02c8p\u00e6r\u0259da\u026as/: \u8d2d\u7269\u8005\u7684\u5929\u5802</li> <li>strategic location /str\u0259\u02c8ti\u02d0d\u0292\u026ak lo\u028a\u02c8ke\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u6218\u7565\u4f4d\u7f6e</li> <li>extensive variety /\u026ak\u02c8st\u025bns\u026av v\u0259\u02c8ra\u026a\u0259ti/: \u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027</li> <li>must-visit destination /m\u028cst-\u02c8v\u026az\u026at \u02ccd\u025bst\u026a\u02c8ne\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u5fc5\u8bbf\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u5730</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_9/#ielts-speaking-preparation-part-3-shopping-at-markets","title":"IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Shopping at Markets","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_9/#1-do-people-in-your-country-enjoy-going-to-open-air-markets-that-sell-things-like-food-or-clothes-or-old-objects-which-type-of-market-is-more-popular-why","title":"1.

Additionally, these markets cater to the needs of young people by allowing them to bargain with ease. Although there are modern supermarkets in China, older people prefer to buy the freshest meat and vegetables at open-air wet markets.

While young people are attracted to the competitive pricing and the ability to bargain, older people prioritize quality and freshness, leading to different shopping experiences and preferences between the generations.</p> <p>Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:</p> <ul> <li>branded and cheap goods /\u02c8br\u00e6nd\u026ad \u0259nd \u02a7i\u02d0p \u0261\u028adz/: \u54c1\u724c\u548c\u4fbf\u5b9c\u7684\u5546\u54c1</li> <li>fascinate the younger generation /\u02c8f\u00e6s\u026ane\u026at \u00f0\u0259 \u02c8j\u028c\u014b\u0259r \u02ccd\u0292\u025bn\u0259\u02c8re\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u8ff7\u4f4f\u5e74\u8f7b\u4e00\u4ee3</li> <li>pocket money /\u02c8p\u0252k\u026at \u02c8m\u028cni/: \u96f6\u82b1\u94b1</li> <li>part-time jobs /\u02ccp\u0251\u02d0rt-ta\u026am d\u0292\u0252bz/: \u517c\u804c\u5de5\u4f5c</li> <li>favorite pastime /\u02c8fe\u026av\u0259r\u026at \u02c8p\u0251\u02d0sta\u026am/: \u6700\u559c\u7231\u7684\u6d88\u9063</li> <li>competitive pricing /k\u0259m\u02c8p\u025bt\u026at\u026av \u02c8pra\u026as\u026a\u014b/: \u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u5b9a\u4ef7</li> <li>bargain /\u02c8b\u0251\u02d0r\u0261\u0259n/: \u780d\u4ef7</li> <li>guarantee the quality /\u02cc\u0261\u00e6r\u0259n\u02c8ti\u02d0 \u00f0\u0259 \u02c8kw\u0252l\u0259ti/: \u4fdd\u8bc1\u8d28\u91cf</li> <li>different preferences /\u02c8d\u026af\u0259r\u0259nt \u02c8pr\u025bf\u0259r\u0259ns\u026az/: \u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u504f\u597d</li> <li>competitive pricing /k\u0259m\u02c8p\u025bt\u026at\u026av \u02c8pra\u026as\u026a\u014b/: \u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u5b9a\u4ef7</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_9/#advanced-vocabulary-and-phrases-summary","title":"Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases Summary","text":"<ul> <li>young people: \u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba</li> <li>wander around side-street stalls: \u95f2\u901b\u8def\u8fb9\u644a</li> <li>open-air flea markets: \u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u8df3\u86a4\u5e02\u573a</li> <li>competitively priced: \u4ef7\u683c\u4f18\u60e0\u7684</li> <li>fashionable: \u65f6\u9ae6\u7684</li> <li>cater to the needs: \u8fce\u5408\u9700\u6c42</li> <li>bargain with ease: \u8f7b\u677e\u780d\u4ef7</li> <li>modern supermarkets: \u73b0\u4ee3\u8d85\u5e02</li> <li>older people: \u8001\u5e74\u4eba</li> <li>open-air wet markets: \u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u519c\u8d38\u5e02\u573a</li> <li>relationship with the vendors: \u4e0e\u644a\u8d29\u7684\u5173\u7cfb</li> <li>security over the origin of the food: \u5bf9\u98df\u54c1\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u611f</li> <li>in my humble opinion: \u4f9d\u6211\u62d9\u89c1</li> <li>giant yard sales: \u5927\u578b\u65e7\u8d27\u9500\u552e</li> <li>knick-knacks: \u5c0f\u73a9\u610f</li> <li>troll dolls: \u5370\u7b2c\u5b89\u6bdb\u5a03</li> <li>antique typewriters: \u53e4\u8463\u6253\u5b57\u673a</li> <li>wall clock: \u6302\u949f</li> <li>longing for: \u6e34\u671b</li> <li>vintage clothes and jewelries: \u8001\u5f0f\u7684\u8863\u670d\u548c\u9996\u9970</li> <li>browse for antiques and collectibles: \u6d4f\u89c8\u53e4\u8463\u548c\u6536\u85cf\u54c1</li> <li>unique and rare items: \u72ec\u7279\u4e14\u7a00\u6709\u7684\u7269\u54c1</li> <li>branded and cheap goods: \u54c1\u724c\u548c\u4fbf\u5b9c\u7684\u5546\u54c1</li> <li>fascinate the younger generation: \u8ff7\u4f4f\u5e74\u8f7b\u4e00\u4ee3</li> <li>pocket money: \u96f6\u82b1\u94b1</li> <li>part-time jobs: \u517c\u804c\u5de5\u4f5c</li> <li>favorite pastime: \u6700\u559c\u7231\u7684\u6d88\u9063</li> <li>competitive pricing: \u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u5b9a\u4ef7</li> <li>bargain: \u780d\u4ef7</li> <li>guarantee the quality: \u4fdd\u8bc1\u8d28\u91cf</li> <li>different preferences: \u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u504f\u597d</li> </ul> <p>Note: Practicing these responses and familiarizing yourself with the advanced vocabulary will help enhance your fluency and coherence during the IELTS Speaking test.</p>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_9/#ielts-speaking-preparation-part-3-shopping-in-general","title":"IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Shopping in General","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_9/#1-what-do-you-think-are-the-advantages-of-buying-things-from-shops-rather-than-markets","title":"1.

There are salespeople absolutely everywhere you look, and they are very polite.

Besides, shops offer the convenience of extended shopping hours, which can extend far into the evening or even operate 24 hours a day. This means there's less stress in making it to the shops on time. Last but not least, in big shops, children can be left in a play area while parents do their shopping, reducing stress and preventing them from being pestered into buying unnecessary items.

Many people don't believe that they're susceptible to being influenced, let alone manipulated by advertising. However, it wouldn't be so omnipresent if it didn't work. Advertising informs people of the existence of products they might be interested in buying. People are more willing to go with what's familiar than what's not. In media, people are usually influenced by what's \"hot\" in the products they see in TV shows, movies, or commercials.

Play is essential to their learning, and it is the main way children discover new things. On the other hand, adults learn new things through relevant experiences they already have. They fit the new information into their existing skills. Additionally, adults are generally much more receptive to learning when they understand the new information being taught. This difference is primarily due to the distinct stages of cognitive and emotional development between children and adults.</p> <p>Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:</p> <ul> <li>natural learners /\u02c8n\u00e6\u0283\u0259r\u0259l \u02c8l\u025c\u02d0rn\u0259rz/: \u5929\u751f\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8005</li> <li>naturally motivated /\u02c8n\u00e6\u0283\u0259r\u0259li \u02c8mo\u028at\u026a\u02ccve\u026at\u026ad/: \u5929\u7136\u5730\u6709\u52a8\u673a\u7684</li> <li>preschoolers /\u02c8pri\u02d0\u02ccsku\u02d0l\u0259rz/: \u5b66\u9f84\u524d\u513f\u7ae5</li> <li>play /ple\u026a/: \u73a9\u800d</li> <li>discover new things /d\u026a\u02c8sk\u028cv\u0259r nju\u02d0 \u03b8\u026a\u014bz/: \u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u4e8b\u7269</li> <li>relevant experiences /\u02c8r\u025bl\u0259v\u0259nt \u026ak\u02c8sp\u026a\u0259ri\u0259nz/: \u76f8\u5173\u7ecf\u9a8c</li> <li>fit the new information /f\u026at \u00f0\u0259 nju\u02d0 \u02cc\u026anf\u0259r\u02c8me\u026a\u0283\u0259n/: \u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f</li> <li>existing skills /\u026a\u0261\u02c8z\u026ast\u026a\u014b sk\u026alz/: \u73b0\u6709\u6280\u80fd</li> <li>receptive /r\u026a\u02c8s\u025bpt\u026av/: \u5584\u4e8e\u63a5\u53d7\u7684</li> <li>understand /\u02cc\u028cnd\u0259r\u02c8st\u00e6nd/: \u7406\u89e3</li> </ul>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/Cambridge_IELTS_9/#3-some-people-say-that-it-is-more-important-to-be-able-to-learn-new-things-now-than-it-was-in-the-past-do-you-agree-or-disagree-with-that-why","title":"3.

Tourism is one of the most prominent sectors that contribute to economic growth. When an increasing number of tourists visit a country, it benefits various industries, including the airline industry, hospitality, food and lodging, and retail businesses. For example, airlines experience higher demand, leading to increased revenue and potentially more job opportunities. Similarly, hotels, restaurants, and local shops see a surge in customers, which boosts their sales and profits. Additionally, tourism can lead to the development of small-scale industries, such as local crafts and souvenirs, providing income to local artisans and entrepreneurs. As tourists explore different regions, they spend money on local attractions, transportation, and entertainment, further stimulating the economy. Moreover, the per capita income tends to rise as businesses expand to cater to the needs of tourists, and the national economy benefits from the overall increase in economic activities.

Do you think a society can benefit if its members have experience of travelling to other countries? In what ways?","text":"<p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>Yes, I strongly believe that a society can greatly benefit from its members' experiences of traveling to other countries. When individuals travel abroad, they bring back valuable knowledge and cultural insights that can be applied to improve various aspects of their home society. For example, exposure to different public transportation systems can inspire improvements in local infrastructure. Personally, after my trip to South Korea, I was encouraged to write to our mayor to advocate for the resumption of train services, aiming to benefit from the convenient public transport similar to what my European friends enjoy. This initiative could help lessen congestion on our roads, making daily commutes more efficient and environmentally friendly.</p> <p>Moreover, travelers often develop a greater sense of global awareness and empathy towards people from different backgrounds.

I met Sam when we were both only five years old, and he quickly became my best friend. When I think of him, what stands out the most is his constantly smiling face, his sense of humor, and his warm and caring disposition that made his inner self truly beautiful.</p> <p>Sam and I lived in the same neighbourhood, where teens and adults alike paid tribute to him. They described him as a good-hearted, quiet yet outgoing boy who loved basketball. I'll always remember him because he was my closest companion before he left home to attend university.</p> <p>One day, a few years ago, we were both working at Starbucks, and it was pouring outside. Before the store was supposed to close, Sam noticed a woman walking without an umbrella in the heavy rain while holding a baby. Without hesitation, he grabbed his umbrella and ran outside to offer her shelter. He asked, \u201cMadam, do you want an umbrella?\" She was so happy and thanked Sam profusely. This act of kindness exemplified his compassion and willingness to help others in need.</p> <p>Sam was always concerned for others and ready to assist those in trouble. As a result of his virtuous cycle, others were more than willing to help him whenever he needed assistance. Additionally, he always lent me a hand whenever I was in trouble or had a puzzled and anxious look on my face. His support made a significant difference in my life.</p> <p>Nowadays, we live on opposite sides of the world and lead very different lives.

One common method is assisting with chores, such as helping elderly neighbors with household tasks. Additionally, volunteer work plays a significant role; for example, I personally walk dogs for the local animal shelter and visit children in hospitals to read to the elderly. These activities, though seemingly small, make a substantial difference in people's lives. Another important avenue is mentoring at community clubs, where teens are guided and supported. School guidance counselors often sponsor programs that encourage students to create skits with positive messages, fostering a sense of responsibility and empathy among the youth.

This ability to empathize fosters a deep sense of compassion, providing a strong motivation to assist those in need. Instead of viewing volunteering as a one-sided act of giving to those less fortunate, many see it as an exchange where mutual support is possible. Most individuals will find themselves in a position of needing help at some point in their lives. Therefore, helping others today could mean receiving support tomorrow when you might be the one in need.

In my observation, individuals today are often more arrogant and self-centered compared to previous generations. There's a noticeable decline in patience and tolerance towards one another, with narcissism and hatred on the rise in both rural and urban areas. Particularly, the wealthy tend to focus on accumulating and attaining wealth, whereas those with fewer resources often spend more time with friends and loved ones. This shift in priorities has led to a decrease in communal support and volunteerism. Additionally, the fast-paced modern lifestyle leaves little time for altruistic activities, making it less likely for people to engage in helping others regularly.

Which groups of people generally need most support in a community? Why?","text":"<p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>I believe that older people generally require the most support within a community. As individuals age, they often face challenges such as declining health, reduced mobility, and increased isolation. It is our responsibility to empower them to enjoy a better quality of life. Many older adults reside in nursing care homes, sheltered housing, or with relatives. However, a significant number live in substandard private sector housing and some even live alone, which exacerbates their vulnerability.</p> <p>Statistics indicate that almost two-thirds of older people feel they need assistance with some aspects of daily living, such as cooking, cleaning, and medical care. The group of older individuals with high support needs is growing, becoming increasingly diverse and facing more complex conditions like dementia. Providing adequate support not only enhances their well-being but also fosters a more compassionate and cohesive community.

For instance, healthcare should be funded by the government, as it is a fundamental right that ensures all citizens have access to necessary medical services. Programs like the Community Service Card can help individuals and their families manage the costs of healthcare by reducing expenses on certain health services and prescriptions.</p> <p>On the other hand, some services, like fitness centres, are more appropriately borne by consumers, as they cater to individual preferences and needs. These services are considered amenities that enhance personal well-being and are often funded through membership fees or usage charges. By having the government fund essential services and allowing individuals to pay for optional amenities, a balanced and sustainable model can be achieved.

It emphasized how providers offering fiber optic connections could deliver exceptionally fast internet speeds, making it ideal for activities like online gaming. This immediately caught my attention because I am an avid gamer, and I had been struggling with internet outages during crucial gaming moments. My home had been using a previous internet service provider whose unreliable service often cut out, especially during peak usage times.</p> <p>What made this advertisement particularly useful was that it didn't directly promote a specific product or company.

The advertisement played a pivotal role in my decision-making process, and I believe it could help others who might be facing similar issues.</p> <p>This advertisement was not just useful but also empowering.

Apart from his basketball success, he's also known for his wonderful family.</p> <p>I became familiar with LeBron James when I was a child. My dad was an avid NBA fan, and he used to watch NBA games regularly. His enthusiasm for the sport rubbed off on me, and I began to take an interest in basketball too. At first, I didn\u2019t have a favorite player since the famous ones were already popular, and I wanted someone unique. That's when I started noticing LeBron James. LeBron had a somewhat polarizing reputation when he first entered the league, but what truly stood out to me was his unwavering determination to chase his dreams. I admire him for his courage and resilience in the face of adversity. He's not just an exceptional player but also an incredible leader and facilitator on the court. He consistently motivates and uplifts his teammates, which contributes to his team's success. In addition, he is such a role model in real life as he has donated millions towards charity and even sponsored a whole school by himself for children who want to go to school but don't have the chance to.</p> <p>In summary, LeBron James is a successful athlete I admire greatly. His remarkable basketball career, including multiple championships and MVP awards, is just one facet of his fame. What makes him truly exceptional is his courage, leadership, and ability to inspire both on and off the basketball court.</p>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/IELTS_speaking/#14-describe-a-bad-service-you-received-in-a-restaurantshop","title":"14.

My friends and I had our usual get-together, and normally, we would hit up a restaurant we liked near our university dorm. But this time, someone decided to change things up.</p> <p>On that day, we met up and started with some bubble tea. As we were sipping our drinks, one of us found a new restaurant online and thought, \"Why not give it a try?\" When we got there, it was packed. Even though we had a reservation, they sat us at a tiny table and then our waiter just vanished. It took forever for the food to arrive, and the service was extremely slow. We were twiddling our thumbs, waiting for a whole hour without any sign of our meals. We were getting seriously hungry and frustrated, so I decided it was time to take action. I tracked down the manager and laid out the whole story, emphasizing how crazy slow the service had been. To my surprise, the manager was super understanding and sorry about the whole thing. To make up for it, he not only ensured our food came out quickly but also told us that our whole dinner was on the house.</p> <p>Looking back on it, I learned that you need to speak up when dealing with bad service. While the initial frustration put a damper on the evening, the manager's effective action turned things around. So, even though we were a bit annoyed at first, we left the place feeling better about it, thanks to the manager stepping up.</p>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/IELTS_speaking/#17-describe-a-rule-that-is-important-in-your-school-or-at-work","title":"17.

Punctuality also applies to meetings, deadlines, and other work-related commitments.</p> <p>When people break this rule, there are consequences. Initially, it might result in verbal warnings or counseling if there are valid reasons for the lateness. Repeated violations can lead to more severe consequences, including written warnings or, in extreme cases, termination of employment.

Being punctual shows that you value your time and that of others. It contributes to a harmonious work environment where everyone can rely on each other to fulfill their duties promptly. Punctuality is also essential for maintaining productivity and meeting deadlines.</p> <p>Personally, I strongly support and adhere to this rule. It instills discipline and a sense of responsibility. When everyone follows this rule, it fosters a positive work culture where people can trust each other to be reliable and efficient. Overall, punctuality is a simple yet vital rule that contributes to a well-functioning and respectful work environment, and I believe it should be upheld and respected by everyone.</p>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/IELTS_speaking/#ielts-speaking-preparation-part-3","title":"IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/IELTS_speaking/#rules-and-regulations","title":"Rules and Regulations","text":"<ol> <li>What rules should children follow at home in your country?</li> </ol> <p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>In China, there are certain rules that children are often encouraged to follow at home. Respect for elders is a fundamental one, which involves addressing elders with appropriate titles and showing deference to their opinions. Studying diligently and excelling in education is highly emphasized, reflecting the importance placed on academic achievement. Additionally, cleanliness and tidiness are important, so children are encouraged to keep their living spaces organized. Finally, traditional values like filial piety, where children show deep respect and care for their parents, are instilled from a young age.</p> <ol> <li>On what occasions can children be forgiven if they don't follow some rules?</li> </ol> <p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>Children can be forgiven for not following some rules on occasions like important holidays or family celebrations, such as Chinese New Year. During these times, there's often a more relaxed atmosphere, and the focus is on togetherness and joy. It's also understood that children may be more excitable or distracted during these events. However, it's essential to strike a balance between forgiveness and maintaining respect and decorum, especially in public or formal settings.</p> <ol> <li>What rules should people follow when using public transport?</li> </ol> <p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>Using public transport comes with many rules that people should follow. Firstly, it's crucial to queue up and wait your turn when boarding buses or trains. Cutting in lines is generally considered impolite and can lead to conflicts. Seats designated for the elderly, disabled, or pregnant passengers should be given up to those who need them. Loud conversations or playing music without headphones should be avoided as they can disturb fellow passengers. Additionally, littering and vandalism on public transport are unacceptable and can result in fines. Overall, it's about being considerate and maintaining a pleasant travel experience for everyone.</p> <ol> <li>Do you think strict rules are necessary in school?</li> </ol> <p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>In my view, having some level of strict rules in school is necessary. These rules create a structured and safe learning environment. They help maintain discipline and ensure that students can focus on their studies without disruption. However, it's essential to strike a balance. Rules should not be excessively strict to the point of stifling individuality or creativity. A balanced approach ensures that students learn discipline while also being able to express themselves and develop their unique talents.</p>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/IELTS_speaking/#sports-and-exercise","title":"Sports and Exercise","text":"<ol> <li>What kind of exercise do Chinese people like to do?</li> </ol> <p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>I would certainly say that table tennis is really popular in China. The equipment is really easy to carry around, all you need are two bats and a ball, which is very minimal. On top of that, the sport does not involve a lot of body contact, unlike basketball. So, most of the Chinese people would like to play table tennis. Additionally, other non-body contact sports like badminton are generally praised by the public. Lastly, basketball is one of the favorite sports in China, enjoyed by many across different age groups.</p> <ol> <li>What characteristics do you think an athlete should have?</li> </ol> <p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>Well, when it comes to the characteristics that athletes should have, there's quite a few. First and foremost, discipline is crucial. Athletes need to stick to rigorous training regimens, stay committed to their sport, and push through challenges. Dedication is another key trait; they must be wholeheartedly invested in their craft. Perseverance is a big one because setbacks are part of the game, and athletes need to keep going. Mental resilience is vital for handling the pressure that often comes with competition. Of course, you can't forget about the physical aspects. Athletes need to be in peak physical condition, so fitness and agility are a must. And let's not overlook teamwork and communication, which are essential for team sports.</p> <ol> <li>Do you think PE classes should be replaced by academic classes?</li> </ol> <p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>No, I don't think Physical Education (PE) classes should be replaced by academic classes. Teamwork and education include both academic and physical development because they complement each other. Physical activity can actually enhance academic performance by improving focus and reducing stress. Therefore, the two should go hand in hand to ensure students receive a holistic education that prepares them for success in all aspects of life.</p> <ol> <li>Is talent important in sports?</li> </ol> <p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>Absolutely, talent plays a crucial role in sports. I think talent serves as the foundation upon which athletes build their skills. Natural abilities like speed, coordination, and strength can provide a significant advantage. I think talent determines how high you can reach as an athlete. However, talent alone isn't sufficient for success. Discipline, hard work, and a strong work ethic are equally vital. Many world-class athletes have reached their pinnacle not solely due to talent but through relentless training and dedication. Talent might open doors, but sustained success in sports demands relentless effort and unwavering commitment to improvement.</p>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/IELTS_speaking/#customer-service-and-response","title":"Customer Service and Response","text":"<ol> <li>How do most people respond to bad services?</li> </ol> <p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>Well, in my opinion, most people tend to respond to bad services with a mix of frustration and disappointment. However, it might also depend on their personality. I have seen some people overreact as they might express their dissatisfaction by complaining directly to the service provider, writing negative reviews, or seeking refunds, and some choose to escalate the issue to management or regulatory authorities. I have also seen some people choose not to say anything and just note down that they may never come to that restaurant again. Ultimately, the response varies depending on the severity of the problem and the individual's personality.</p> <ol> <li>Do you think services are better now than in the past?</li> </ol> <p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>In many ways, yes, services have improved over time thanks to advancements in technology and increased competition, which have raised the bar for service quality in various industries. Today, some services often have more choices, better convenience, and faster responses. Where one place does something, another place may copy, bringing more new ideas and ways to attract customers. However, the perception of service quality can be subjective and varies from person to person. Some customers may prefer certain ways of service, while others might want to keep it simple.</p> <ol> <li>What kinds of services are bad service?</li> </ol> <p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>Bad services can take many forms. They can include poor customer support, delayed deliveries, subpar product quality, or unmeasured services. Any service that falls short of customer expectations or violates agreed-upon standards can be considered bad service. However, again, some customers just have certain expectations naturally, so it varies depending on the person's expectations.</p> <ol> <li>Why do some people choose to remain silent when they receive bad services?</li> </ol> <p>Sample Answer:</p> <p>Well, I think there are several reasons why some people remain silent about bad services. They might fear confrontation, thinking that they would rather not make a scene than complain directly and possibly never come back to the place. Others might believe that it's not worth their time and effort, or worry about potential repercussions. The rest might not be aware of their rights as consumers or feel resigned to accept poor service as normal. In some cases, it's about personal temperament; not everyone is inclined to complain openly when they encounter problems.</p> <p>SAMPLE1:</p> <p>1-INTRO</p> <p>When I saw this topic, the first person that popped up in my mind is my neighbour Ms Li, who lives just a stone's throw away from my home.

To tell you more about it, this park is a popular destination in my community, which is just a stone's throw away from my home. So one afternoon, during one summer vacation, while my friends and I were discussing where to recharge and unwind after final exams, I suggested having a picnic party together in this park. After that, we usually go there.</p> <p>2-WHAT</p> <p>Speaking of what it is like and what you often do there, well, I wanna share with you. Talking about the scenery of the park, it's second to none. In fact, it's like a paradise for all my friends to enjoy the serene and picturesque view. When we go there, we enjoy the lush greenery and vibrant flowers along the peaceful walking paths. In terms of the leisure activities in the park, they're also beyond compare.

In fact, her home is located in a great neighbourhood, which is just a stone's throw away from the city centre. Therefore, we can see a spectacular view of the city from the large French window of the living room. In terms of what I can do in it, my friends and I usually curl up on her cozy sofa, watching our favourite reality show, while eating fruits and snacks.

To tell you more about it, this competition is quite a popular annual event at our university that attracts almost everyone to gather and watch it each year. However, I was extremely nervous about this competition when I was preparing for it because I'm not very confident in giving a speech. Whenever I thought of the possibility of failing it, I felt a bit down in the dumps.</p> <p>2-WHAT</p> <p>Speaking of why you thought it was a difficult challenge, well, On the first few days, we found it difficult to write a perfect draft because we were completely lost and didn't know where to begin. As a result, we started procrastinating and felt blue. But as they say, \"There's light at the end of the tunnel.\" A day later, I discussed with my teammates and we gave each other tons of tips and guidance. We made a detailed plan that could break this task into many small and doable steps, which could help us finish the draft more efficiently and with better quality. Later on, we began to make progress and finished our speech draft in just two days. Finally, we were over the moon to find out we got the third place for the competition.</p> <p>3-WHY/HOW</p> <p>When it comes to how I felt at the time, well, I have mixed feelings about it as it was both a challenging but inspiring process. It was such a challenge because I almost didn't make it, while it was truly inspiring to witness myself overcome obstacles and become a better version of myself along the way. To conclude, this experience is deeply rooted in my mind and will be cherished by me forever. It always puts a smile on my face whenever I think of it.</p> <p>SAMPLE6:</p> <p>1-INTRO</p> <p>When I saw this topic, the first occasion that popped up in my mind was helping my 20-year-old cousin, Olivia, decide to apply to the computer science programme at her dream university. To tell you more about it, it happened last winter, when the Spring Festival was just around the corner, when I was visiting my aunt's, you know, Olivia's mum's place. Olivia asked me if I could help her because she knew I have a knack for coding and I'm working as an AI engineer. In fact, she's always been interested in the theory and usage of coding. Unfortunately, the things she learned in school have nothing to do with computer science or mathematics. Because of that, she wasn't sure she could pull it off so she asked me for advice.</p> <p>2-WHAT</p> <p>Speaking of how I helped, well, First, I told her what studying computer science at university is like, including the courses she would take and how challenging the exams can be. This gave her a basic understanding of the major and a clear picture of what to expect in the near future. I also talked about career prospects, for example, I shared what my work life is like, including my schedule and salary. I was hoping to show her that this is a promising career path that's worth pursuing. Finally, I encouraged her to believe in herself. I helped her see that no matter what major she chooses, she'll succeed because she's both smart and hardworking.</p> <p>3-WHY/HOW</p> <p>When it comes to how I felt about the experience, well, A few months later, she told me she had made up her mind in the end and was admitted to her dream school. To be honest, I was over the moon and even burst into tears when I first heard the news. On top of that, it was such an honor when she asked me to accompany her to the college's opening ceremony. To conclude, this experience is deeply rooted in my mind and I will cherish this memory forever. In the future, whenever I think of it, it will always put a smile on my face.</p>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/IELTS_writing/","title":"\u96c5\u601d\u5199\u4f5c","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/IELTS_writing/#_1","title":"\u96c5\u601d\u5199\u4f5c","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/IELTS_writing/#writing","title":"Writing","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/IELTS_writing/#task-1","title":"Task 1","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/IELTS_writing/#remember","title":"Remember \uff1a","text":"<ol> <li> <p>The task is to describe what you see.</p> </li> <li> <p>Write a report.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don't give opinions.</p> </li> <li> <p>No conclusion.</p> </li> <li> <p>Instead write a summary(overview).</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/IELTS_writing/#question-types","title":"Question types","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Line graph</p> </li> <li> <p>Bar chart</p> </li> <li> <p>Pie chart</p> </li> <li> <p>Table</p> </li> <li> <p>numbers</p> <ul> <li> <p>describe</p> </li> <li> <p>compare</p> </li> <li> <p>changes / trends</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Diagram - comparing</p> </li> <li> <p>Diagram - process</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/IELTS_writing/#essay-structure","title":"Essay structure","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Introduction</p> </li> <li> <p>Overview</p> </li> <li> <p>2 sentences</p> </li> <li> <p>The main, general things</p> </li> <li> <p>Details</p> </li> <li> <p>Details</p> </li> <li> <p>Why 2 paragraphs?</p> </li> <li> <p>This makes you organise or group the information better.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/IELTS_writing/#task-2","title":"Task 2","text":""},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/IELTS_writing/#an-ielts-training-course","title":"An IELTS training course","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Understand the task</p> </li> <li> <p>Write an essay</p> <ul> <li> <p>Minimum 250 words</p> </li> <li> <p>40 minutes</p> </li> <li> <p>Universal topics</p> </li> <li> <p>4 question types</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Four scoring criteria</p> <ol> <li> <p>Task response</p> </li> <li> <p>Coherence and cohesion</p> </li> <li> <p>Vocabulary</p> </li> <li> <p>Grammer</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Break the task into parts</p> </li> <li> <p>250 words</p> </li> <li> <p>4 paragraphs</p> </li> <li> <p>about 13 sentences</p> </li> <li> <p>Introduction</p> <ul> <li> <p>2 sentences</p> </li> <li> <p>Introduce the topic</p> </li> <li> <p>give a general answer</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Two main paragrahs</p> <ul> <li>5 sentences in each</li> <li>90 - 100 words each</li> <li> <p>Conclusion</p> </li> <li> <p>1 sentence</p> </li> <li>never write anything new</li> <li>one sentence: repeat, summarise</li> <li> <p>Timing (40 minutes)</p> </li> <li> <p>Planning: 10 minutes</p> </li> <li> <p>Introduction : 5 minutes</p> </li> <li> <p>Main body : 20 minutes</p> </li> <li> <p>Conclusion: 5minutes</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Methods, techniques</p> </li> <li> <p>Lots of practice</p> </li> <li> <p>FeedBack, measure progress</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/IELTS_writing/#four-types-of-question","title":"Four types of question:","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Discussion</p> </li> <li> <p>Opinion</p> </li> <li> <p>Problem and solution</p> </li> <li> <p>Two-part question</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"LANGUAGE/English/IELTS_writing/#1-discussion","title":"1.
