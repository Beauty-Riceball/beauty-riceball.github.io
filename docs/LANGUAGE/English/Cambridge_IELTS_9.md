---

#### **_1. What games are popular in your country? [Why?]_**

**Sample Answer:**

I would say **reality shows** and **talent shows** are probably the most popular types of TV programmes in my country. However, focusing on traditional games, **children** enjoy playing games like **marbles** and **hopscotch**. **Tug of war** is also highly popular, which is a game that directly pits two teams against each other in a test of **strength**. During my childhood, hopscotch was my favorite game because it was simple yet engaging.

The idea that "everyone's a winner" is rather **naive**. Playing competitive games helps me develop a strong sense of **achievement**, **resilience**, and **strategic thinking**, which are valuable skills in both personal and professional settings.

I'd like to talk about a vibrant street market I visited in London that left a lasting impression on me. It's located just a two-minute bus ride from my hotel in the city center. The market is tucked away in a narrow alley, making it a hidden gem despite its central location. If you're looking for clothes or accessories, this market is definitely the place to be. However, be cautious with your wallet unless you're prepared to make some purchases, as the variety and quality of items can be quite tempting!

The market is much larger than it appears from the outside. Once you step inside, you'll find a sprawling array of stalls specializing in everything you can think of—from handmade jewelry and vintage clothing to unique home décor and artisanal snacks. The massive range of snack bars, cafes, and various shops ensures that visitors can spend hours exploring without getting bored.

One of the main reasons I enjoyed visiting this market was the sheer diversity of products available. Whether you're a fashion enthusiast, a food lover, or someone looking for unique souvenirs, there's something for everyone. Additionally, the atmosphere is always lively and bustling, filled with the sounds of vendors calling out their goods and the aroma of freshly prepared street food.

Another highlight of this market is the regular events they host, such as live music performances and cultural exhibitions, which add an extra layer of enjoyment to the shopping experience. Personally, I visited the market on a Wednesday when they were offering a 10% discount on selected items, which was a fantastic opportunity to snag some high-quality designer pieces at affordable prices. The friendly and approachable vendors also made the experience more pleasant, as they were always ready to help and engage in conversations.

Overall, this street market is a shopper's paradise. Its strategic location, extensive variety of products, and vibrant atmosphere make it a must-visit destination for both locals and tourists alike.

I think most Chinese people enjoy shopping at open-air markets. **Young people** particularly like to **wander around side-street stalls** and **open-air flea markets**.

Additionally, these markets **cater to the needs** of young people by allowing them to **bargain with ease**. Although there are modern supermarkets in China, **older people** prefer to buy the freshest meat and vegetables at **open-air wet markets**. Unlike in the big food chains, shoppers develop a certain **relationship with the vendors**, allowing them to learn how the vegetables have been grown and who produced them.

During the weekend, I always look for **antiques** or **vintage clothes and jewelries**. I think an **antique flea market** is a very fascinating place.

---

#### **_1. What do you think are the advantages of buying things from shops rather than markets?_**

**Sample Answer:**

First and foremost, the **customer service** in shops is superior to that in markets. There are **salespeople absolutely everywhere** you look, and they are very **polite**. I have never been so impressed with the staff at **upscale designer boutiques** in my life; they are not **snooty** and even encourage me to **try things on**. Besides, shops offer the **convenience of extended shopping hours**, which can **extend far** into the evening or even operate **24 hours a day**. This means there's less **stress** in making it to the shops on time. **Last but not least**, in big shops, children can be left in a **play area** while parents do their shopping, reducing **stress** and preventing them from being **pestered into buying unnecessary items**.

#### **_2. How does advertising influence what people choose to buy? Is this true for everyone?_**

Advertising **informs** people of the **existence** of products they might be interested in buying. People are more willing to **go with what's familiar** than what's not. In media, people are usually influenced by what's "hot" in the products they see in **TV shows**, **movies**, or **commercials**.

#### **_1. Why do you think some people like doing new things?_**

**Sample Answer:**

Trying new things often involves **high risk**, but despite this, some people prefer to **face new challenges** rather than follow a routine. I believe the main reason they enjoy trying new things is their **adventurous character**. By nature, I am an **adventurous person**. My mother used to say that she struggled hard to stop me from **climbing trees** when I was young. Maybe I **displayed** my adventurous character from my childhood itself. I would rather **try new things** as opposed to repeating the same old activities. This inclination towards novelty helps individuals grow, learn new skills, and keep life exciting and fulfilling.

It's crucial for individuals to know how to **motivate themselves**, as I believe it is one of the most important factors leading a person towards success. Additionally, some people **pressure themselves** and become extremely **worried about making mistakes**. This can **impose a lot of pressure** on them. To overcome these issues, **keeping calm** is essential. Developing confidence and maintaining a positive mindset can help individuals navigate the uncertainties of trying new activities.

#### **_3. Do you think it's best to do new things on your own or with other people? Why?_**

**Sample Answer:**

I believe it's best to **do new things with other people** rather than on your own. Personally, I'm scared of **trying new things on my own** and I'm used to having friends **tag along** with me. When I do new things without any company, I may feel **awkward** and fear that I will **make a complete fool out of myself** by either being too quiet or **babbling**. My mind often tells me that I'm **stupid** while everyone else is **intelligent**, which makes me feel **inadequate**. However, if I bring a friend along, I behave **normally**. I think **being with others** is essential because that's how **society functions**. Look at any animal group, like ants or lions—**pack animals** must work together for the group to survive. Having companions not only makes the experience more enjoyable but also provides support and reduces anxiety.

**Sample Answer:**

Young children should learn how to **cook** and do other **chores**, such as **sweeping** and **changing a light bulb**, because this will prepare them for the future when they leave the **nest**. These activities help them **build responsibility** and **earn respect** from their parents. That's what most children are missing today.

---

#### **_2. Do you think children and adults learn to do new things in the same way? How is their learning style different?_**

**Sample Answer:**

In my perspective, children and adults **learn to do new things in totally different ways**. Young children are **natural learners** and are **naturally motivated** to learn about new things. Especially, **preschoolers** learn differently from adults. **Play** is essential to their learning, and it is the main way children **discover new things**. On the other hand, adults learn new things through **relevant experiences** they already have. They **fit the new information** into their existing skills. Additionally, adults are generally much more **receptive** to learning when they **understand** the new information being taught. This difference is primarily due to the distinct stages of cognitive and emotional development between children and adults.

---

#### **_3. Some people say that it is more important to be able to learn new things now than it was in the past. Do you agree or disagree with that? Why?_**

**Sample Answer:**

Frankly, I **agree** with that statement. Now, we are under constant pressure to learn new things, which can be both **daunting** and **exhilarating**. Some pundits **deride** the current era as just another **bubble**, but whether it is or not, **new and heady technologies** are emerging every day. People have to have the ability to **keep pace with the times**. No one can discount the way that **mobile technology** and other **breakthroughs** are changing our way of life. People around the globe should be able to **catch up with** these advancements. Comparing people today to those of the 1970s or before, never before have we had such **luxury** in terms of access to information and learning resources.

Whenever I pick up the phone, I **break out in cold sweat** and feel **clammy**. This condition makes me hesitant to make calls, as I worry about saying something wrong or being judged.

I'll never forget this trip because it was the first time I was travelling without a **home base**. Most of the cities in Korea are perfectly safe, as they are well-populated and every major venue, shopping area, and tourist destination is safe, well-lit, and properly patrolled. Even when I go out at night as a single woman, I'm not scared. **Cheju Island** has many wonderful walking areas, lots of hiking trails, and beautiful beaches to explore by foot.

Traveling to other countries offers a wealth of learning opportunities.

Additionally, **immersing oneself in a foreign culture** is one of the most effective ways to **learn a new language**. Being surrounded by native speakers and engaging in everyday conversations accelerates language acquisition far more than classroom learning. Furthermore, travelers often develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of different **material lifestyles** and **attitudes towards various aspects of life**, such as work, family, and leisure. This broadens their perspective, making them more open-minded and adaptable in an increasingly globalized world.

When an increasing number of tourists visit a country, it **benefits various industries**, including the **airline industry**, **hospitality**, **food and lodging**, and **retail businesses**. For example, airlines experience higher demand, leading to increased revenue and potentially more job opportunities. Similarly, hotels, restaurants, and local shops see a surge in customers, which boosts their sales and profits. Additionally, tourism can lead to the development of **small-scale industries**, such as local crafts and souvenirs, providing income to local artisans and entrepreneurs. As tourists explore different regions, they spend money on **local attractions**, **transportation**, and **entertainment**, further stimulating the economy. Moreover, the **per capita income** tends to rise as businesses expand to cater to the needs of tourists, and the **national economy** benefits from the overall increase in economic activities.

---

#### **_1. How popular are bicycles in your home town? [Why?]_**

**Sample Answer:**

Bicycles are **less popular** in my hometown than they were ten years ago. This decline is primarily because our **living conditions** have been **advancing rapidly**, allowing more people to **afford private cars** for commuting to work or school. Additionally, the government has been **paving more roads and expressways** to accommodate the increasing number of automobile owners. As a result, many people prefer the convenience and comfort of cars over bicycles for their daily transportation needs.

---

#### **_2. How often do you ride a bicycle? [Why/Why not?]_**

**Sample Answer:**

I ride a bicycle to work every day because it is faster than walking, and I don't have to get on a crowded bus. Plus, the traffic is always **heavy** in the big city, especially during the **rush hour**.

#### **_3. Do you think that bicycles are suitable for all ages? [Why/Why not?]_**

**Sample Answer:**

I don't believe bicycles are suitable for all ages, especially for children in China. It's dangerous for kids to ride bicycles because there are many cars that **turn very fast** when crossing intersections. I think that kids need to wear **helmets** and other **protective gear** to ensure their safety. Unfortunately, I hardly ever see anyone wearing any kind of protective equipment, which increases the risk of accidents. Therefore, while bicycles can be a great mode of transport, appropriate safety measures must be in place to protect younger riders.

Physically, cycling helps improve fitness and overall health. Financially, bicycles are much cheaper to maintain and use than cars, saving money on fuel and repairs. Environmentally, bicycles produce no emissions, making them a greener mode of transportation. Additionally, cycling can reduce traffic congestion and the overall carbon footprint of a city. These reasons make cycling a great choice for those seeking a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle.

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 2 - Describe a Person Who Has Done a Lot of Work to Help People

---

**_Describe a person who has done a lot of work to help people. You should say:_**

- **_who this person is/was_**
- **_where this person lives/lived_**
- **_what he/she has done to help people_**
- **_and explain how you know about this person._**

---

**Sample Answer:**

I'd like to tell you about my close friend, **Sam**, who has always been dedicated to helping others. I met Sam when we were both only five years old, and he quickly became my best friend. When I think of him, what stands out the most is his **constantly smiling face**, his **sense of humor**, and his **warm and caring disposition** that made his inner self truly beautiful.

Sam and I lived in the same **neighbourhood**, where teens and adults alike paid tribute to him. They described him as a **good-hearted**, **quiet yet outgoing** boy who loved basketball. I'll always remember him because he was my closest companion before he left home to attend university.

One day, a few years ago, we were both working at Starbucks, and it was **pouring outside**. Before the store was supposed to close, Sam noticed a woman walking without an umbrella in the heavy rain while holding a baby. Without hesitation, he grabbed his umbrella and ran outside to offer her shelter. He asked, “Madam, do you want an umbrella?" She was so happy and thanked Sam profusely. This act of kindness exemplified his **compassion** and willingness to help others in need.

Sam was always concerned for others and ready to assist those in trouble. As a result of his **virtuous cycle**, others were more than willing to help him whenever he needed assistance. Additionally, he always **lent me a hand** whenever I was in trouble or had a puzzled and anxious look on my face. His support made a significant difference in my life.

Nowadays, we live on opposite sides of the world and lead very different lives. However, whenever I receive a call from him, my heart beats like a drum, and just hearing his voice can make me smile so big that my cheeks hurt. He always tries his hardest to protect me and ensure my well-being. If only the world were full of people like him, we would all feel much safer and more supported.

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Helping Other People in the Community

---

#### **_1. What are some of the ways people can help others in the community? Which is the most important?_**

**Sample Answer:**

There are numerous ways people can contribute to their community. One common method is assisting with **chores**, such as helping elderly neighbors with household tasks. Additionally, **volunteer work** plays a significant role; for example, I personally **walk dogs** for the local animal shelter and **visit children in hospitals** to read to the elderly. These activities, though seemingly small, make a substantial difference in people's lives. Another important avenue is **mentoring** at community clubs, where teens are guided and supported. **School guidance counselors** often **sponsor** programs that encourage students to create **skits** with positive messages, fostering a sense of responsibility and empathy among the youth. Among these, **volunteer work** is the most important as it directly addresses immediate needs and builds a stronger, more compassionate community.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **chores** /ʧɔːrz/: 家务
- **volunteer work** /ˌvɒlənˈtɪər wɜːrk/: 义工工作

---

#### **_2. Why do you think some people like to help other people?_**

**Sample Answer:**

I believe some people are driven to help others because they are willing to **put themselves in other people's shoes**. This ability to empathize fosters a deep sense of **compassion**, providing a strong motivation to assist those in need. Instead of viewing **volunteering** as a one-sided act of giving to those less fortunate, many see it as an **exchange** where mutual support is possible. Most individuals will find themselves in a position of needing help at some point in their lives. Therefore, helping others today could mean receiving support tomorrow when you might be the one in need. This reciprocal relationship encourages a culture of generosity and solidarity within the community.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **put themselves in other people's shoes** /pʊt ðɛmˈsɛlvz ɪn ˈʌðər ˈpiːplz ʃuːz/: 从他人的角度思考

- **solidarity** /ˌsɒlɪˈdærəti/: 团结

---

#### **_3. Some people say that people help others in the community more now than they did in the past. Do you agree or disagree? Why?_**

**Sample Answer:**

I disagree with the notion that people are helping others in the community more now than in the past. In my observation, individuals today are often **more arrogant** and **self-centered** compared to previous generations. There's a noticeable decline in **patience** and **tolerance** towards one another, with **narcissism** and **hatred** on the rise in both rural and urban areas. Particularly, the wealthy tend to focus on **accumulating and attaining wealth**, whereas those with fewer resources often spend more time with friends and loved ones. This shift in priorities has led to a decrease in communal support and volunteerism. Additionally, the fast-paced modern lifestyle leaves little time for altruistic activities, making it less likely for people to engage in helping others regularly. Therefore, I believe that the spirit of community assistance has diminished rather than strengthened over time.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **arrogant** /ˈærəɡənt/: 傲慢的
- **self-centered** /sɛlf-ˈsɛntərd/: 自我中心的

- **spirit of community assistance** /ˈspɪrɪt əv kəˈmjuːnɪti əˈsɪstəns/: 社区援助精神

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Community Services

---

#### **_1. What types of services, such as libraries or health centres, are available to the people who live in your area? Do you think there are enough of them?_**

**Sample Answer:**

In my community, there are a variety of essential **neighbourhood conveniences** that cater to the diverse needs of residents. These include **grocery store chains**, **dry cleaners**, **barbers**, and a wide **range of restaurants** that cater to different tastes and preferences. Additionally, there are ample **natural spaces** for enjoying the outdoors, such as parks and walking trails, as well as a well-equipped **gym** that meets personal fitness needs.

Furthermore, the area boasts several **coffeehouses** and **bars** where people can **hang out** and socialize, fostering a strong sense of community. **Auto-related amenities** like **car washes** and **fueling stations** are also readily available, ensuring that residents have access to necessary services without having to travel far. While these services are **too numerous to mention individually**, I believe the community is well-served in terms of accessibility and variety. However, there is always room for improvement, especially in expanding services that cater to the elderly and other vulnerable groups to ensure inclusivity for all residents.

---

#### **_2. Which groups of people generally need most support in a community? Why?_**

**Sample Answer:**

I believe that **older people** generally require the most support within a community. As individuals age, they often face challenges such as declining health, reduced mobility, and increased isolation. It is our responsibility to **empower** them to enjoy a better quality of life. Many older adults reside in **nursing care homes**, **sheltered housing**, or with **relatives**. However, a significant number live in **substandard private sector housing** and some even live alone, which exacerbates their vulnerability.

Statistics indicate that almost two-thirds of older people feel they need assistance with some aspects of **daily living**, such as cooking, cleaning, and medical care. The group of older individuals with **high support needs** is growing, becoming increasingly diverse and facing more complex **conditions** like **dementia**. Providing adequate support not only enhances their well-being but also fosters a more compassionate and cohesive community. Ensuring that older members have access to necessary services and social support systems is crucial for their dignity and overall quality of life.

---

#### **_3. Who do you think should pay for the services that are available to the people in a community? Should it be the government or individual people?_**

**Sample Answer:**

I believe that the **government** should bear the primary responsibility for funding essential **community services** such as healthcare, libraries, and public transportation. For instance, **healthcare** should be **funded by the government**, as it is a fundamental right that ensures all citizens have access to necessary medical services. Programs like the **Community Service Card** can help individuals and their families manage the costs of healthcare by reducing expenses on certain health services and prescriptions.

On the other hand, some services, like **fitness centres**, are more appropriately **borne by consumers**, as they cater to individual preferences and needs. These services are considered **amenities** that enhance personal well-being and are often funded through membership fees or usage charges. By having the government fund essential services and allowing individuals to pay for optional amenities, a balanced and sustainable model can be achieved. This approach ensures that everyone has access to basic necessities while still providing opportunities for personal choice and investment in one's health and leisure activities.
