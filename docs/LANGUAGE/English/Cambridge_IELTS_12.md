### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 2 - Describe an Occasion When You Had to Wait a Long Time for Someone or Something to Arrive

---

***Describe an occasion when you had to wait a long time for someone or something to arrive. You should say:***

- ***who or what you were waiting for***
- ***how long you had to wait***
- ***why you had to wait a long time***
- ***and explain how you felt about waiting a long time.***

---

**Sample Answer:**

I'd like to talk about the time when I waited for an entire day for a camera to be delivered to me.

Last year, I **bought a Fujifilm instant camera** online as a birthday gift for my friend Wei. I **ordered it on Tuesday**, and it was supposed to be **delivered to me on Thursday**. I thought it was perfect because Friday was her birthday, and I would have enough time to **wrap the gift** and **give it to her** at the **party we were throwing** for her.

However, on Wednesday morning, it started to **snow**, and the roads became quite **slippery**. I received a phone call from the delivery company saying that the delivery might be **delayed** because several highways were **sealed**, but they would try their best to make it.

I was quite **anxious** the whole time while waiting for the camera, as I had feared there would be no delivery on Thursday. The next day, I called the company again, and they told me that the camera was **on its way** but there was no guarantee it would arrive that day. I explained to them that it was an **important gift** and requested them to give it some **priority**. I was **pacing the room** when the doorbell rang at 5 pm. I rushed to the intercom to open the door for the delivery man. You have no idea how **relieved** I felt when I finally got it in my hand. It was definitely an **unforgettable experience**.

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Arriving Early

---

#### ***1. In what kinds of situations should people always arrive early?***

**Sample Answer:**

Well, in situations when **time is of the essence**, I suppose. For example, if you need to take a plane, you should always **arrive at the airport early** because the **security check** takes a long time and the plane will not wait for you. Also, if your **lateness may be taken as a sign of disrespect**, for example, if you are meeting someone for the first time, it is quite rude to be late.

#### ***2. How important is it to arrive early in your country? [Why?/Why not?]***

**Sample Answer:**

I suppose it depends on who you are meeting with and what you are meeting for. If you are meeting a **friend for a casual meal** or something, he or she probably wouldn't be too upset if you **run a bit late**. However, if you are meeting with someone you are not that familiar with, or for some **important matters**, it is quite **advisable** that you **get there a bit early**. After all, **punctuality** is a sign of **reliability**. Being late is not exactly fashionable in Chinese culture.

#### ***3. How can modern technology help people to arrive early? [Why?/Why not?]***

**Sample Answer:**

Yes, many people are using their smartphones to make sure that they won't be late for important events. Once you have **put them on your calendar**, a **reminder** will **pop up** on the screen and the **alarm clock** will **go off** one hour before the event. If you have **installed a flight app**, it will send you **reminders** three hours before your **departure time** automatically. Some **traffic apps** can help you **calculate the fastest route** to get to your destination. This helps you to **arrive early** as well.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **put them on your calendar** /pʊt ðɛm ɒn jɔːr ˈkælɪndər/: 记录在日历上

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Being Patient

---

#### ***1. What kinds of jobs require the most patience?***

**Sample Answer:**

In my opinion, jobs involving children are probably the most **demanding** as far as patience is concerned. Unlike adults, most children are still learning how to **communicate effectively** with others. Sometimes they have difficulty **expressing their wants and needs**. And when they don't get what they want, they may even **throw a temper tantrum**. It takes a lot of patience to spend hours and hours with children.

- **spend hours and hours** /spɛnd ˈaʊərz ənd ˈaʊərz/: 花费大量时间

---

#### ***2. Is it always better to be patient in work (or studies)? [Why?/Why not?]***

**Sample Answer:**

Yeah, I think so. Generally speaking, when you **lose your patience**, it is more likely for you to **make mistakes** and **fail to notice** the details. A patient person is also usually better at **communicating with co-workers** because he or she is more willing to listen. This will **encourage collegiality** and allow the whole team to work more efficiently.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **generally speaking** /ˈdʒɛnərəli ˈspiːkɪŋ/: 一般来讲
- **lose your patience** /luːz jɔːr ˈpeɪʃəns/: 失去耐心

- **encourage collegiality** /ɪnˈkɜːrɪdʒ kəˌliːˈdʒiːəlɪti/: 增强协作
- **work more efficiently** /wɜːrk mɔːr ɪˈfɪʃəntli/: 更高效地工作

---

#### ***3. Do you agree or disagree that the older people are, the more patient they are? [Why?/Why not?]***

**Sample Answer:**

Yeah, I agree it's probably right. I mean, when you get older, you are also **inclined to become wiser** because you have much **experience of life**. You will be better at **handling complex information** and **analyzing** it. Therefore, you don't get confused as often and won't **lose patience easily**. Plus, your experience may also teach you to be more **patient with others** because you are more **tolerant of others' faults**.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **inclined to become wiser** /ɪnˈklaɪnd tuː bɪˈkʌm ˈwaɪzər/: 倾向于变得更聪明
- **experience of life** /ɪkˈspɪəriəns əv laɪf/: 生活经验

Later, thanks to her **training in dancing**, she was able to put on **breathtaking performances** in three well-known Kungfu films: **“Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,”** **“Hero,”** and **“House of Flying Daggers.”** She was able to give **elegance** and **vivacity** to her Kungfu moves, leaving a **lasting impression** on the audience.

From then on, she has been **slowly but surely polishing** her acting skills to perfection. With the **outstanding job** she did in **“The Grand Master,”** she won all major Chinese film awards for **best actress in a leading role**. Until today, no other Chinese actress has been able to achieve that with just one film. Such an achievement certainly helped her **gain popularity** among film-goers of all ages. There is no doubt that she is one of the **greatest actresses** in China.

I suppose when you watch a film in the cinema, the **sound and visual effects** are probably **better** because of the **mega screens** and **powerful stereo systems**.

I believe going to a cinema is not just about watching the film, but the whole **experience**. You will get this great feeling when the whole audience **burst into laughter** because of a funny scene or **break into applause** at the end of a great film.

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Theatre

---

#### ***1. How important is the theatre in your country's history?***

**Sample Answer:**

I would say it played a rather **significant part** in our history. When we talk about Chinese theatre, I suppose the first thing people think of is **Beijing Opera**. This great art form **dates back to** the 18th century and has been considered a **national treasure**. In the past, since there were not that many types of entertainment, many people went to the theatres regularly to enjoy Beijing Opera. During the **Qing Dynasty**, it became so popular that almost everyone could sing one song or two from the most famous plays.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

#### ***2. How strong a tradition is it today in your country to go to the theatre? [Why?/Why not?]***

**Sample Answer:**

Unfortunately, I don't think it is as strong a **tradition** to go to the theatre as it was in the past. **Beijing Opera** is more of an **acquired taste**. It **takes time to** learn its **vocabulary** and understand the stories. Nowadays, there are so many other types of entertainment for people to choose from. Therefore, theatre is **losing its attraction** for young people, which is really sad if you ask me.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **tradition** /trəˈdɪʃən/: 传统
- **acquired taste** /əˈkwaɪərd teɪst/: 逐渐培养的爱好
- **takes time to** /teɪks taɪm tuː/: 需要花时间来…
- **vocabulary** /vəˈkæbjʊləri/: 词汇
- **losing its attraction** /ˈluːzɪŋ ɪts əˈtrækʃən/: 失去吸引力

---

#### ***3. Do you think that the theatre should be run as a business or as a public service? [Why?/Why not?]***

**Sample Answer:**

I believe it should be run as a **hybrid**. The business part gives people who work in the theatre an **incentive** to **better themselves**. However, the problem with business is that it's **too profit-driven**. If a business is not bringing enough profit, it will be closed. The theatre should be more than that because it's a part of our **cultural legacy** which should be more **accessible**. And for such a reason, it should also be partially run as a **public service**.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **hybrid** /ˈhaɪbrɪd/: 混合体
- **incentive** /ɪnˈsɛntɪv/: 激励
- **better themselves** /ˈbɛtər ðɛmˈsɛlvz/: 让他们做得更好

- **public service** /ˈpʌblɪk ˈsɜːrvɪs/: 公共服务

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 2 - Describe an Interesting Discussion You Had About How You Spend Your Money

---
    
***Describe an interesting discussion you had about how you spend your money. You should say:***

- ***who you had the discussion with***
- ***why you discussed this topic***
- ***what the result of the discussion was***
- ***and explain why this discussion was interesting for you.***

---
    
**Sample Answer:**
    
Funny, I should get this topic. I mean, I'm probably one of the least financially savvy people in the world. But I guess I can talk about a discussion I once had with my best friend.
    
First, let me tell you something about my best friend, **Lily**. We go way back, and she was always a **precocious child**. Unlike other young people, including myself, who always have an empty **wallet** towards the end of each month, she spends her money wisely. It seems that she always knows how to get her money's worth for whatever she buys. 
    
So, one day this topic came up in our conversation, and I asked her about her secret to money management. And she told me that the first step is, surprise surprise, **creating a budget**. As a **hopeless impulse shopper**, I asked her how to avoid buying things on the spur of the moment. She said that her trick was to **reward herself with occasional treats**, like going to the spa or the theater, just to keep her spirits up. That's why she always sets aside a small amount of money in her budget for those things.
    
I remember we also **argued** about whether it's better to buy name brands or generic brands. She insisted that one should know when to spend for quality, **investing more** in higher-quality essentials, like a nice pair of jeans that goes with anything and lasts for a long time. 
    
I wouldn't say that this conversation has changed my life, because as we know, it's always easier said than done. But I'm lucky to have such a friend who I can **emulate**. I suppose I would have saved a lot by now if I had really followed her advice.

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Money and Young People

---

#### ***1. Why do some parents give their children money to spend each week?***

**Sample Answer:**

Well, I think there are a couple of reasons why parents give their children **allowances**, but the most important one is to teach their children **financial literacy**. Allowances are a child's first exposure to **money management**, and they can also be a powerful tool to teach them about **patience** and **decision-making**. For example, if they really want an expensive toy, they have to decide whether they should **save up** to buy it or **rethink its value**. I understand some parents are worried that free money could **spoil children**, but I believe it's really up to what kind of strategies the parents use. For example, **tying allowances to chores** is a great way to teach children **responsibility**.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **allowances** /əˈlaʊənsɪz/: 给零花钱
- **financial literacy** /faɪˈnænʃəl ˈlɪtərəsi/: 理财常识
- **money management** /ˈmʌni ˈmænɪdʒmənt/: 理财管理
- **patience** /ˈpeɪʃəns/: 耐心
- **decision-making** /dɪˈsɪʒən ˈmeɪkɪŋ/: 决策
- **save up** /seɪv ʌp/: 存钱
- **rethink its value** /riːˈθɪŋk ɪts ˈvæljuː/: 重新考虑其价值
- **spoil children** /spɔɪl ˈʧɪldrən/: 宠溺孩子
- **tying allowances to chores** /taɪɪŋ əˈlaʊənsɪz tuː ʧɔːrz/: 把零花钱和完成家务挂钩
- **responsibility** /rɪˌspɒnsəˈbɪləti/: 责任

---

#### ***2. Do you agree that schools should teach children how to manage money? [Why?/Why not?]***

**Sample Answer:**

Absolutely. In fact, I'm outraged that **money management** is not featured in most of the schools in China. I mean, if the purpose of public schooling is to raise **sensible, functioning members of society**, then **financial literacy** should definitely be part of the **curriculum**. I also strongly believe that this education should start **early** when children are forming their **good habits**. If some parents or schools are uncomfortable with letting their children handle money at an early age, they could use **alternatives** or **games**, like the board game **Monopoly**, to teach children the basics of **personal finance**.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **money management** /ˈmʌni ˈmænɪdʒmənt/: 理财管理
- **outraged** /aʊtˈreɪʤd/: 愤怒的
- **sensible, functioning members of society** /ˈsɛnsəbl, ˈfʌŋkʃənɪŋ ˈmɛmbərz əv səˈsaɪəti/: 在社会中发挥作用的人

- **good habits** /ɡʊd ˈhæbɪts/: 形成良好的习惯
- **alternatives** /ɔːlˈtɜːrnətɪvz/: 替代品
- **personal finance** /ˈpɜːrsənl faɪˈnæns/: 个人理财

#### ***3. Do you think it is a good idea for students to earn money while studying? [Why?/Why not?]***

**Sample Answer:**

Well, generally, I don't think students should work unless the circumstances force them to, like if they have other family members to support. Of course, you can argue that having a **job** builds **character** and helps the students gain **experience** so that they are better prepared for the real world. However, trying to work a **full-time job**, or even a **part-time job** while attending college will almost inevitably lead to **inferior results** in both areas. Studying for a degree is already a full-time job. Education is supposed to be students’ **focus** and **top priority** at this stage, not just a **hoop to jump through**. Plus, what's the point of listing on your **resume** the experience of working part-time at a **grocery store** that has nothing to do with your **career goals**? I believe it's way more beneficial for college students to **volunteer** in **fields** that are related to their future career.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **job** /ʤɒb/: 工作
- **character** /ˈkærɪktər/: 品格
- **experience** /ɪkˈspɪəriəns/: 经验
- **full-time job** /fʊl taɪm ʤɒb/: 全职工作

- **top priority** /tɒp praɪˈɒrɪti/: 最高优先级
- **hoop to jump through** /huːp tuː ʤʌmp θruː/: 必须完成的任务
- **resume** /rɪˈzjuːm/: 简历
- **grocery store** /ˈɡrəʊsəri stɔːr/: 杂货店
- **career goals** /kəˈrɪər ɡəʊlz/: 职业目标
- **volunteer** /ˌvɒləˈnɪər/: 志愿者
- **fields** /fiːldz/: 领域

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Money and Society

---

#### ***1. What disadvantages are there in a society where the gap between rich and poor is very large?***

**Sample Answer:**

A huge **wealth gap** will definitely lead to a lot of **social problems**. It seems to me that people value **equality above growth**, and when there's a significant disparity between the rich and the poor, it can foster a **widespread sense of injustice** among the lower class. Those who are less affluent may feel **less secure** because there is a **breakdown** in social cohesion and trust. Additionally, wealth tends to **concentrate in the hands of a few powerful individuals**, exacerbating the imbalance. This natural tendency leads to **inequitable distribution of resources**, making it difficult for the less privileged to improve their circumstances. Such disparities can result in increased **crime rates**, **social unrest**, and a general decline in the overall **quality of life** for a large portion of the population.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **wealth gap** /wɛlθ gæp/: 财富差距
- **social problems** /ˈsoʊʃəl ˈprɒbləmz/: 社会问题
- **value equality above growth** /ˈvæljuː ɪˈkwɒləti əˈbʌv groʊθ/: 价值平等高于增长

- **crime rates** /kraɪm reɪts/: 犯罪率
- **social unrest** /ˈsoʊʃəl ənˈrɛst/: 社会动荡

#### ***3. Do you think that global economic inequality has an impact on world peace and international trade? [Why?/Why not?]***

**Sample Answer:**

Yes, I think it's not only a **moral obligation** but also **beneficial for the global economy** as a whole. Just as the wealth gap within a country can lead to social issues, global economic inequality also has detrimental effects on **world peace** and **international trade**. However, by "help," I don't mean simply providing **aid** during disasters, but rather **regular, continuous economic aid** is likely to foster better economic stability. This is because **financial support** can help underdeveloped regions improve their infrastructure and education systems, thereby reducing poverty and fostering a more stable and peaceful global community. When countries are economically balanced, there is less incentive for conflict over resources, and international trade can flourish without the underlying tensions caused by inequality.
