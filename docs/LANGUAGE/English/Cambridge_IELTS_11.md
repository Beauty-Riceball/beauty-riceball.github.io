To speak fairly, she used to be popular in the kitchen, till one day, she went to a **nutrition class**, and everything was **ruined**.

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 2 - Describe a House/Apartment That Someone You Know Lives In

---

**_Describe a house/apartment that someone you know lives in. You should say:_**

- **_whose house/apartment this is_**
- **_where the house/apartment is_**
- **_what it looks like inside_**
- **_and explain what you like or dislike about this person's house/apartment._**

---

**Sample Answer:**

I'd like to talk about my father's friend, whom I affectionately call **Uncle Wu**. He is a post-modern sculptor and lives in a spacious **home-studio** located in the **Chaoyang District** of Beijing, near the **North Fifth Ring Road**. He named his residence **“Wu Zhi Zhai”**, which translates to **“The House of Innocence and Ignorance”**.

Uncle Wu's studio was originally an **obsolete warehouse**. About 20 years ago, he moved to Beijing with nothing but dreams. Unable to afford a decent place in the city, he had to make do with this dilapidated warehouse. At that time, the **Fifth Ring Road** hadn't been constructed yet, and the warehouse was in a location unknown even to some locals. It was there that he began his journey into art, gradually gaining fame. After earning his first significant income, he decided to purchase the warehouse and transform it into a **fascinating artwork**.

The first major renovation involved replacing the **leaky roof** with an arrangement of **translucent and transparent reinforced glasses**, allowing natural light to flood the space. Next, he removed the **concrete floor** and filled it with soil, making it suitable for planting various types of **vegetation**. In the southern part of the house, he paved a yard with **pebbles** and constructed a small **two-story house**. The garden is adorned with **curious-looking metal sculptures** that blend seamlessly with the plants, giving them a lifelike appearance.

What I particularly admire about Uncle Wu's house is not just its unique architecture but also the underlying philosophy. The artificial sculptures placed amidst the natural greenery symbolize the idea that without the garden, these sculptures would be lifeless. This arrangement serves as a poignant reminder that humans are often **innocent and ignorant** in the face of **nature's grandeur**.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **home-studio** /ˈhoʊm ˈstuːdiəʊ/: 家庭工作室
- **Chaoyang District** /ˌtʃaʊˈjɑːŋ ˈdɪstrɪkt/: 朝阳区
- **North Fifth Ring Road** /nɔːθ fɪfθ rɪŋ roʊd/: 北五环路

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Different Types of Home

---

#### **_1. What kinds of home are most popular in your country? Why is this?_**

**Sample Answer:**

Definitely not a **big house** in the countryside. First of all, it's too **expensive**. Second, **traffic** in China is **no joke**; no one would really enjoy living too far off the **city centre** except some **super-rich** people who have too much time and money to **squander** and who don't **commute** at all. I think the **ideal type of home** in China is a **medium-size apartment** on higher floors in a **high-rise building** that is not too far from the **city centre** with a **good view** outside the window and all the modern **conveniences** available in the **neighbourhood**: shopping centres, hospitals, entertainments, parks, sports facilities, schools, etc.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **big house** /bɪɡ haʊs/: 大房子
- **expensive** /ɪkˈspɛnsɪv/: 昂贵的
- **traffic** /ˈtræfɪk/: 交通

- **neighbourhood** /ˈneɪbərhʊd/: 社区

#### **_2. What do you think are the advantages of living in a house rather than an apartment?_**

**Sample Answer:**

Well, can I say I don't know since I've only lived in a house? The only difference I can think of now is that you may have a **garden** or probably an additional **backyard** of your own, but I personally don't see it as an **advantage** at all. **Chinese people** don't really **appreciate the culture of gardening**. We don't know what to do with an **open lot**, especially when it's not big enough to do **farming** on. And besides, nowadays, who has the time to **take care of branches and leaves** anyway? Another difference is that there would be **less people around** if you lived in a house. But we Chinese people love having a lot of **neighbours** so that when we need help, **helping hands** come fast. So, like I said, living in a house doesn't seem very **appealing**.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **garden** /ˈɡɑːrdən/: 花园
- **backyard** /ˈbækjɑːrd/: 后院
- **advantage** /ədˈvæntɪdʒ/: 优势

- **open lot** /ˈoʊpən lɒt/: 空地

- **take care of branches and leaves** /teɪk keər əv ˈbræntʃɪz ənd liːvz/: 照料树枝和叶子
- **less people around** /lɛs ˈpiːpl əˈraʊnd/: 周围的人更少
- **neighbours** /ˈneɪbərz/: 邻居
- **helping hands** /ˈhɛlpɪŋ hændz/: 援助
- **appealing** /əˈpiːlɪŋ/: 有诱惑力的

---

#### **_3. Do you think that everyone would like to live in a larger home? Why is that?_**

**Sample Answer:**

Well, I think that **varies from case to case**. For people who currently **dwell in a small place**, a **larger home** is absolutely what they would fight for. My family **crowded** in a small apartment when I was young. There wasn't enough space to stand a desk in my bedroom, so I had to do my homework on the bed. Now I have a room twice as big, but **doing cleaning** has become a new problem. **Chinese philosophy** believes that **beyond the limits** is as bad as **falling short**. So, I would say everyone would like to live in a home that is **big enough**.

- **falling short** /ˈfɔːlɪŋ ʃɔːrt/: 不足
- **big enough** /bɪɡ ɪˈnʌf/: 足够大的

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Finding a Place to Live

---

#### **_1. How easy is it to find a place to live in your country?_**

**Sample Answer:**

It's hard to say definitively as it largely depends on two factors: the **depth of your pocket** and the **complexity of your requirements**. If budget isn't a concern, you can simply call a **rental agency**, communicate your needs, and then wait for a suitable place to become available. Nowadays, this process can be easily managed through a **smartphone**, making the **ideal home** just a **click away**. Additionally, if you don't have high expectations, finding a place becomes relatively straightforward. However, if you're striving to **strike a balance** between **economy** and **comfort**, you'll need a considerable amount of **patience** and perseverance.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **depth of your pocket** /dɛpθ əv jɔːr ˈpɒkɪt/: 经济状况

- **economy** /ɪˈkɒnəmi/: 经济
- **comfort** /ˈkʌmfərt/: 舒适
- **patience** /ˈpeɪʃəns/: 耐心

---

#### **_2. Do you think it's better to rent or to buy a place to live in? Why?_**

**Sample Answer:**

Unless I have decided to **settle down** in a place for the rest of my life, I would prefer to **rent a house**. Firstly, **housing prices** here are **preposterous**. In my hometown, the average **annual income** is approximately thirty thousand RMB. Even if someone can manage to **save half** of their income, it would still take them forty years to **finally afford** a house. Moreover, my hometown is only a **third-tier city**, so you can imagine the situation in major **metropolises** like Beijing and Shanghai, where the housing market is even more competitive and expensive.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **settle down** /ˈsɛtl daʊn/: 定居
- **rent a house** /rɛnt ə haʊs/: 租房
- **housing prices** /ˈhaʊzɪŋ ˈpraɪsɪz/: 房价

---

#### **_3. Do you agree that there is a right age for young adults to stop living with their parents? Why is that?_**

**Sample Answer:**

Yes, it makes perfect sense. I believe it's very important for young adults to **stop living with their parents** so that they can truly learn to **take responsibilities** and become **independent**. Parents, especially **Chinese parents**, tend to be **over-protective** or, in some cases, **manipulative**. They often employ all possible means to ensure their children are safely on the “right track." As a result, many young people in China, when faced with trouble, **turn to their parents for help** instead of **seeking solutions independently**. In China, while everyone grows old, not everyone grows **mature**. I seriously believe that this cultural tendency needs to be changed to foster greater independence and self-reliance among young adults.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **stop living with their parents** /stɒp ˈlɪvɪŋ wɪð ðɛər ˈpærənts/: 停止与父母同住
- **take responsibilities** /teɪk rɪˌspɒnsəˈbɪlətiz/: 承担责任

- **over-protective** /ˌoʊvər-prəˈtɛktɪv/: 过度保护的
- **manipulative** /məˈnɪpjʊlətɪv/: 有操纵欲的
- **turn to their parents for help** /tɜːrn tuː ðɛər ˈpærənts fɔːr hɛlp/: 向父母寻求帮助
- **seeking solutions independently** /ˈsiːkɪŋ səˈluːʃənz ˌɪndɪˈpɛndəntli/: 独立寻找解决方案
- **mature** /məˈtjʊər/: 成熟的

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 2 - Describe a Day When You Thought the Weather Was Perfect

---

**_Describe a day when you thought the weather was perfect. You should say:_**

- **_where you were on this day_**
- **_what the weather was like on this day_**
- **_what you did during the day_**
- **_and explain why you thought the weather was perfect on this day._**

---

**Sample Answer:**

I'd like to talk about a beautiful autumn day in 2014 when the weather was exceptionally good. I was in my hometown, **Beijing**, which was the host city of the **2014 APEC meeting**. It was the first day of the APEC meeting in early **November**. After a long spell of **smoggy days** in October, we finally saw the **azure sky** with **white clouds**. What made it even better was that the **temperature** was just about right for **outdoor activities**.

In order to celebrate the APEC event, the residents of Beijing were given a **few extra days off**. Some people chose to travel to other places, but I decided to stay in Beijing to **appreciate its scenic beauty** on such nice days. A couple of friends and I went to **Beihai Park** and took quite a few pictures there, including the beautiful **white tower** and people who were **boating on the lake**.

The great weather of that day was particularly memorable because of the huge contrast between that day and the **severely smoggy days** before and after it. This weather condition was even coined **“APEC blue”** by the media to signify its rarity. After all, it was a result of the government's action that **thousands of factories** were shut down during that period and the number of **vehicles** on the streets was also cut in half. We were all hoping that the nice weather would last for a few more weeks, but it didn't.

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Types of Weather

#### **_1. What types of weather do people in your country dislike most? Why is that?_**

**Sample Answer:**

I would say Chinese people **hate smoggy days** the most. Due to the **severe industrial pollution** and **car exhaust emissions**, a large part of China is affected by smog. People are worried that such **weather conditions** would **constitute a huge health hazard**.

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Weather Forecasts

---

#### **_1. How important do you think it is for everyone to check what the next day's weather will be? Why?_**

**Sample Answer:**

I would say it is quite important for people to **check the next day's weather**. One has to **make decisions** about what to wear, whether to bring an umbrella, and even what kind of **transportation** to take. For instance, if it rains, it's probably a good idea to **opt for public transportation** since people have to **drive more slowly** on rainy days, and there are typically more **traffic accidents**. Additionally, knowing the weather in advance helps in planning outdoor activities and ensures safety and comfort throughout the day.

---

#### **_2. What is the best way to get accurate information about the weather?_**

**Sample Answer:**

In my opinion, the best way to obtain accurate information about the weather is to **use a weather app** on your **smartphone**. I no longer watch the **weather forecast on TV** these days since weather can be quite **fickle** and **prone to change** within a short period of time. The **weather forecasts** on these apps are more **reliable** because they are **updated hourly** or even more **frequently**, providing more **precise** information. Additionally, these apps often offer **real-time alerts** and **detailed forecasts** that help users stay informed about sudden weather changes.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **use a weather app** /juːz ə ˈwɛðər æp/: 使用天气应用程序

---

#### **_3. How easy or difficult is it to predict the weather in your country? Why is that?_**

**Sample Answer:**

I suppose it really **depends on which part of China** we are talking about since it is such a **huge country**. For the **inland regions**, the weather is usually **easier to forecast** as it is generally more **stable**. However, for the **coastal areas**, especially those in the **subtropics** which are greatly affected by the **subtropical monsoons**, it might be much more **challenging to predict** the weather. The **variability** in these regions, influenced by factors like **ocean currents** and **humidity levels**, makes accurate weather prediction more complex. Additionally, rapid urbanization and environmental changes can also impact the **reliability** of weather forecasts.

- **depends on which part of China** /dɪˈpɛndz ɒn wɪʧ pɑːrt əv ˈʧaɪnə/: 取决于中国的哪个部分

- **_what the documentary was about_**
- **_why you decided to watch it_**
- **_what you learnt during the documentary_**
- **_and explain why the TV documentary was particularly interesting._**

---

**Sample Answer:**

I'm going to talk about a truly fascinating documentary about **New Zealand** that I watched on TV a couple of years ago. It was by far one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.

I did not watch it intentionally; I was just **flipping through the channels** when I came across this show. There was a **Maori man** with **tattoos** all over his face who instantly **grabbed my attention**. His presence and the cultural elements presented in the documentary piqued my interest immediately.

During the documentary, I **learnt** a multitude of things about New Zealand, including its **geographical location**, **climate**, and **rich cultural heritage**. The **vast forests** and **magnificent mountains** were showcased so impressively on the screen. It was mentioned that the **Lord of the Rings** trilogy was filmed there, which added to the allure of the country. As a **sports enthusiast**, I also discovered that **New Zealanders** are incredibly passionate about **rugby**, a sport I have always wanted to try myself.

What I found most **fascinating** about the documentary was the in-depth **introduction to Maori culture**. It was an **eye-opening experience** to learn that you can **deduce** so many aspects, such as **accolades** and **statuses**, of a Maori person from the **jade** they are wearing and the **tattoos** on their faces. The **highlight** of the documentary was the **haka**, originally a **war dance** intended to **intimidate enemies**, and now more commonly performed by New Zealand sports teams before a match starts. In the show, a Maori man **explained to the audience** the **meaning** behind each **hand gesture** and **pose** used in the haka. It was so much fun learning about these cultural practices that I **plan to travel** to New Zealand very soon to experience all these things with my own eyes.

---

#### **_1. What are the most popular kinds of TV programmes in your country? Why is this?_**

**Sample Answer:**

I would say **reality shows** and **talent shows** are probably the most popular types of TV programmes in my country. Most of the reality shows have **garnered a lot of public attention** because of their **star-studded cast**. On the other hand, talent shows are designed to get the public to **root for** some contestants who are just ordinary people.

If you're not really **into** game shows, there are plenty of other types of programmes for you to choose from. More game shows simply mean **fiercer competitions** for **audience ratings** between different networks and TV stations. This **pushes** the creators of the shows to **come up with** better ideas to attract viewers.

Most of the **senior citizens** are still watching the news on TV regularly; however, younger people prefer to get news on their **smartphones** since it's more **up-to-date** and more **efficient**. Newspapers used to be a major outlet for news as well, but the sales of **copies of newspapers** have been dwindling as the news **apps** on smartphones and tablets are taking their place.

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - TV Advertising

---

#### **_1. What types of products are advertised most often on TV? Why is this?_**

**Sample Answer:**

According to my observation, **food** and **household products** are advertised most frequently on TV. It stands to reason that **housewives** constitute a major part of the TV audience and are therefore **targeted** by TV stations.

---

#### **_2. Do you think that people pay attention to adverts on TV? Why do you think that is?_**

**Sample Answer:**

To be honest, I don't think most people pay much attention to TV commercials unless those commercials are quite interesting. One major reason for this is that most of the ads are played between episodes of a TV series or two different shows. Most people would use that time to go to the bathroom, stand up, and stretch a little bit. That is also why **time slots for ads** right after and before each show are the most expensive. If the commercials are engaging or entertaining, people are more likely to pay attention to them; otherwise, they tend to ignore them.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **to be honest** /tuː biː ˈɒnɪst/: 实话实说
- **TV series** /tiːˈviː ˈsɪəriːz/: 电视剧
- **time slot** /taɪm slɒt/: 播放时段

- **engaging** /ɪnˈɡeɪdʒɪŋ/: 吸引人的
- **entertaining** /ˌɛntərˈteɪnɪŋ/: 娱乐的
- **ignore** /ɪɡˈnɔːr/: 忽视

---

#### **_3. How important are regulations on TV advertising?_**

**Sample Answer:**

Regulations on TV advertising play a rather **significant role** in the protection of **public interest**. It is essential to **thoroughly prescribe standards** regarding what can be advertised on TV and how they can be advertised. Moreover, it is even more important to **supervise and monitor** TV stations' **compliance** with such regulations. Any **breach of these rules** should be subject to **penalties** in order to **deter further non-compliance**. These regulations ensure that advertisements are truthful, do not mislead consumers, and maintain ethical standards in broadcasting.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **play a rather significant role** /pleɪ ə ˈræðər sɪɡˈnɪfɪkənt roʊl/: 扮演相当重要的角色

### Essay 1

!!! note "Question"
_Governments should spend money on railways rather than roads. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience._

**Essay:**

Governments should prioritize spending on **railways** rather than **roads** to enhance a country's **infrastructure** and promote **sustainable development**. I strongly agree with this statement because investing in railways offers numerous economic, environmental, and social benefits.

Firstly, railways are more **environmentally friendly** compared to roads. Trains emit significantly fewer **greenhouse gases** per passenger kilometer than cars and buses, contributing to the reduction of **carbon emissions**. For example, the expansion of high-speed rail networks in countries like Japan and Germany has led to decreased reliance on air travel and private vehicles, thereby mitigating **air pollution** and combating **climate change**.

Secondly, investing in railways can stimulate economic growth. Efficient rail systems facilitate the **movement of goods and people**, reducing transportation costs and time. This connectivity is crucial for **business operations**, as it enables smoother logistics and access to wider markets. For instance, the development of the **European Union's rail network** has enhanced trade and mobility among member states, fostering **economic integration** and cooperation.

Moreover, railways can alleviate **traffic congestion** on roads, leading to improved **urban mobility** and quality of life. By providing a reliable and efficient alternative to road transport, trains can reduce the number of vehicles on highways, decreasing **commuting times** and enhancing **public transportation** systems. Cities like London and Paris have benefited from extensive rail networks that support their dense populations and bustling economies.

However, it is essential to maintain a balanced approach. While railways offer significant advantages, roads remain indispensable for **last-mile connectivity** and **rural accessibility**. Therefore, governments should allocate funds to both rail and road infrastructure, ensuring comprehensive and integrated transportation systems.

In conclusion, prioritizing spending on railways over roads is a strategic decision that promotes **environmental sustainability**, **economic efficiency**, and **social well-being**. The long-term benefits of robust rail networks justify the initial investment, making it a preferable choice for modern governments.

### Essay 2

!!! note "Question"
_In the future, nobody will buy printed newspapers or books because they will be able to read everything they want online without paying. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience._

**Essay:**

The rapid advancement of **digital technology** has transformed the way we **consume information**, leading some to predict that **printed newspapers and books** will become **obsolete**. I partially agree with this statement, as while **digital reading** will dominate, there will still be a market for **printed materials**.

One significant advantage of **online reading** is its **accessibility and convenience**. **Digital platforms** allow users to access a vast array of information instantly from anywhere, often at a lower cost or for free. For example, **e-books** can be downloaded to various devices, eliminating the need for **physical storage** and making it easier to carry multiple books at once. Additionally, **online newspapers** can be updated in **real-time**, providing the latest news without waiting for the next day's print edition. These benefits make **digital reading** an attractive option for many, contributing to the decline of **printed materials**.

However, there are still compelling reasons why **printed newspapers and books** will continue to be relevant. Many people prefer the **tactile experience** of reading on paper, finding it more enjoyable and easier on the eyes compared to screens. Moreover, **printed materials** do not rely on **electronic devices** or **internet connectivity**, making them accessible in environments where **digital access** is limited. For instance, books are often cherished as collectibles and passed down through generations, preserving **cultural heritage**. Furthermore, certain **academic and professional fields** still rely heavily on **printed resources** for their **credibility and permanence**.

In conclusion, while **digital reading** will increasingly overshadow **printed newspapers and books** due to its **convenience and accessibility**, there will remain a **niche market** for **printed materials** driven by **personal preferences** and specific needs.

### Essay 3

!!! note "Question"
_Some people say that History is one of the most important school subjects. Other people think that, in today’s world, subjects like Science and Technology are more important than History. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion._

**Essay:**

The debate over the importance of **History** compared to **Science and Technology** in school curricula is ongoing. Some argue that History is crucial for understanding our past, while others believe that Science and Technology subjects are more relevant in today's world.

Proponents of **History** emphasize that it teaches us about our **heritage** and helps prevent past mistakes. By learning about historical events, students can gain insights into **societal developments** and **cultural identities**. For example, studying world wars can highlight the consequences of conflict, promoting peace and empathy. Furthermore, History fosters **critical thinking** by analyzing **cause and effect** relationships over time.

Conversely, supporters of Science and Technology subjects argue that they are essential for future **innovation** and **economic growth**. In an increasingly **globalized world**, skills in these areas are in high demand. For instance, knowledge in **computer science** or **biotechnology** can lead to advancements that improve quality of life. Additionally, these subjects encourage **problem-solving** and **creativity**, which are valuable in various career paths.

In my opinion, while **History** provides important lessons from the past, Science and Technology subjects are more critical in preparing students for the future. However, a balanced curriculum that includes both these areas would be most beneficial, ensuring students are well-rounded and equipped with diverse skills.

### Essay 4

!!! note "Question"
_In some cultures, children are often told that they can achieve anything if they try hard enough. What are the advantages and disadvantages of giving children this message? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience._

**Essay:**

Encouraging children by telling them they can achieve anything with enough effort is a common practice in many cultures. While this message can inspire and motivate, it also has potential drawbacks that need to be considered.

One significant advantage of this message is that it **fosters a strong work ethic** and **resilience** in children. Believing that hard work can **overcome obstacles** encourages **persistence** and **dedication**, essential traits for **personal and professional success**. For example, a child who is told they can excel academically if they study diligently is more likely to develop effective study habits and a **commitment to learning**. Additionally, this **positive reinforcement** can boost **self-esteem** and confidence, enabling children to take on challenges and pursue their goals with determination.

However, there are also disadvantages to this approach. Telling children they can achieve anything may set **unrealistic expectations**, leading to disappointment and frustration when they encounter failures. For instance, a child who is constantly told they can become a professional athlete might experience **significant stress and anxiety** if they do not possess the necessary talent or face injuries. Furthermore, this message can overlook the importance of **external factors** such as **socio-economic status**, **access to resources**, and **inherent abilities**, which play crucial roles in achieving success. Consequently, children might develop a **skewed perception of reality**, believing that effort alone is sufficient to **overcome all barriers**.

In my opinion, while encouraging children to strive for their goals is beneficial, it is equally important to teach them about the complexities and challenges they may face. **Balancing motivation with realistic expectations** can help children develop both ambition and **resilience**.
