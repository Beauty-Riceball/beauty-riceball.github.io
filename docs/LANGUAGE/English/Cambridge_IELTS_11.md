### Essay 1

!!! note "Question"
*Governments should spend money on railways rather than roads. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.*

**Essay:**

Governments should prioritize spending on **railways** rather than **roads** to enhance a country's **infrastructure** and promote **sustainable development**. I strongly agree with this statement because investing in railways offers numerous economic, environmental, and social benefits.

Firstly, railways are more **environmentally friendly** compared to roads. Trains emit significantly fewer **greenhouse gases** per passenger kilometer than cars and buses, contributing to the reduction of **carbon emissions**. For example, the expansion of high-speed rail networks in countries like Japan and Germany has led to decreased reliance on air travel and private vehicles, thereby mitigating **air pollution** and combating **climate change**.

Secondly, investing in railways can stimulate economic growth. Efficient rail systems facilitate the **movement of goods and people**, reducing transportation costs and time. This connectivity is crucial for **business operations**, as it enables smoother logistics and access to wider markets. For instance, the development of the **European Union's rail network** has enhanced trade and mobility among member states, fostering **economic integration** and cooperation.

Moreover, railways can alleviate **traffic congestion** on roads, leading to improved **urban mobility** and quality of life. By providing a reliable and efficient alternative to road transport, trains can reduce the number of vehicles on highways, decreasing **commuting times** and enhancing **public transportation** systems. Cities like London and Paris have benefited from extensive rail networks that support their dense populations and bustling economies.

However, it is essential to maintain a balanced approach. While railways offer significant advantages, roads remain indispensable for **last-mile connectivity** and **rural accessibility**. Therefore, governments should allocate funds to both rail and road infrastructure, ensuring comprehensive and integrated transportation systems.

In conclusion, prioritizing spending on railways over roads is a strategic decision that promotes **environmental sustainability**, **economic efficiency**, and **social well-being**. The long-term benefits of robust rail networks justify the initial investment, making it a preferable choice for modern governments.

### Essay 2

!!! note "Question"
*In the future, nobody will buy printed newspapers or books because they will be able to read everything they want online without paying. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.*

**Essay:**

The rapid advancement of **digital technology** has transformed the way we **consume information**, leading some to predict that **printed newspapers and books** will become **obsolete**. I partially agree with this statement, as while **digital reading** will dominate, there will still be a market for **printed materials**.

One significant advantage of **online reading** is its **accessibility and convenience**. **Digital platforms** allow users to access a vast array of information instantly from anywhere, often at a lower cost or for free. For example, **e-books** can be downloaded to various devices, eliminating the need for **physical storage** and making it easier to carry multiple books at once. Additionally, **online newspapers** can be updated in **real-time**, providing the latest news without waiting for the next day's print edition. These benefits make **digital reading** an attractive option for many, contributing to the decline of **printed materials**.

However, there are still compelling reasons why **printed newspapers and books** will continue to be relevant. Many people prefer the **tactile experience** of reading on paper, finding it more enjoyable and easier on the eyes compared to screens. Moreover, **printed materials** do not rely on **electronic devices** or **internet connectivity**, making them accessible in environments where **digital access** is limited. For instance, books are often cherished as collectibles and passed down through generations, preserving **cultural heritage**. Furthermore, certain **academic and professional fields** still rely heavily on **printed resources** for their **credibility and permanence**.

In conclusion, while **digital reading** will increasingly overshadow **printed newspapers and books** due to its **convenience and accessibility**, there will remain a **niche market** for **printed materials** driven by **personal preferences** and specific needs.

### Essay 3

!!! note "Question"
*Some people say that History is one of the most important school subjects. Other people think that, in today’s world, subjects like Science and Technology are more important than History. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.*

**Essay:**

The debate over the importance of **History** compared to **Science and Technology** in school curricula is ongoing. Some argue that History is crucial for understanding our past, while others believe that Science and Technology subjects are more relevant in today's world.

Proponents of **History** emphasize that it teaches us about our **heritage** and helps prevent past mistakes. By learning about historical events, students can gain insights into **societal developments** and **cultural identities**. For example, studying world wars can highlight the consequences of conflict, promoting peace and empathy. Furthermore, History fosters **critical thinking** by analyzing **cause and effect** relationships over time.

Conversely, supporters of Science and Technology subjects argue that they are essential for future **innovation** and **economic growth**. In an increasingly **globalized world**, skills in these areas are in high demand. For instance, knowledge in **computer science** or **biotechnology** can lead to advancements that improve quality of life. Additionally, these subjects encourage **problem-solving** and **creativity**, which are valuable in various career paths.

In my opinion, while **History** provides important lessons from the past, Science and Technology subjects are more critical in preparing students for the future. However, a balanced curriculum that includes both these areas would be most beneficial, ensuring students are well-rounded and equipped with diverse skills.

### Essay 4

!!! note "Question"
*In some cultures, children are often told that they can achieve anything if they try hard enough. What are the advantages and disadvantages of giving children this message? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.*

**Essay:**

Encouraging children by telling them they can achieve anything with enough effort is a common practice in many cultures. While this message can inspire and motivate, it also has potential drawbacks that need to be considered.

One significant advantage of this message is that it **fosters a strong work ethic** and **resilience** in children. Believing that hard work can **overcome obstacles** encourages **persistence** and **dedication**, essential traits for **personal and professional success**. For example, a child who is told they can excel academically if they study diligently is more likely to develop effective study habits and a **commitment to learning**. Additionally, this **positive reinforcement** can boost **self-esteem** and confidence, enabling children to take on challenges and pursue their goals with determination.

However, there are also disadvantages to this approach. Telling children they can achieve anything may set **unrealistic expectations**, leading to disappointment and frustration when they encounter failures. For instance, a child who is constantly told they can become a professional athlete might experience **significant stress and anxiety** if they do not possess the necessary talent or face injuries. Furthermore, this message can overlook the importance of **external factors** such as **socio-economic status**, **access to resources**, and **inherent abilities**, which play crucial roles in achieving success. Consequently, children might develop a **skewed perception of reality**, believing that effort alone is sufficient to **overcome all barriers**.

In my opinion, while encouraging children to strive for their goals is beneficial, it is equally important to teach them about the complexities and challenges they may face. **Balancing motivation with realistic expectations** can help children develop both ambition and **resilience**.
