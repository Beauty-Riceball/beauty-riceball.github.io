### Essay 1

!!! note "Question"
*In some countries, owning a home rather than renting one is very important for people. Why might this be the case? Do you think this is a positive or negative situation? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.*

**Essay:**

Owning a home is often considered a significant milestone in many countries, holding substantial **cultural and economic importance**. While some believe that **homeownership** provides **stability and security** and **investment benefits**, others argue that it may lead to **financial strain** and reduced **mobility**.

One primary reason people value **owning a home** is the sense of **stability and security** it provides. **Homeowners** have a permanent place to live, free from the uncertainties of **rental agreements** and potential **eviction**. For instance, **owning a house** allows families to **establish roots** in a community, fostering stronger **social connections** and support networks. Additionally, **property ownership** is viewed as a long-term **investment** that can **appreciate over time**, offering financial benefits and **wealth accumulation**.

However, **owning a home** can also have both positive and negative impacts on individuals and society. On the positive side, it can enhance personal satisfaction and pride, contributing to overall well-being. On the negative side, the **financial burden** of **mortgage payments**, **maintenance costs**, and **property taxes** can be overwhelming, especially in **high-cost areas**. Furthermore, **owning a home** can reduce an individual's flexibility to relocate for better job opportunities or personal reasons, potentially limiting **career growth** and personal development.

In my opinion, while **owning a home** offers numerous benefits such as **stability** and **investment potential**, it is essential to consider the **financial responsibilities** and potential **limitations** it imposes. Therefore, **homeownership** can be both a **positive** and **negative** situation depending on an individual's circumstances and priorities.

### Essay 2

!!! note "Question"
*In the future, nobody will buy printed newspapers or books because they will be able to read everything they want online without paying. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.*

**Essay:**

The rapid advancement of **digital technology** has transformed the way we **consume information**, leading some to predict that **printed newspapers and books** will become **obsolete**. I partially agree with this statement, as while **digital reading** will dominate, there will still be a market for **printed materials**.

One significant advantage of **online reading** is its **accessibility and convenience**. **Digital platforms** allow users to access a vast array of information instantly from anywhere, often at a lower cost or for free. For example, **e-books** can be downloaded to various devices, eliminating the need for **physical storage** and making it easier to carry multiple books at once. Additionally, **online newspapers** can be updated in **real-time updates**, providing the latest news without waiting for the next day's print edition. These benefits make **digital reading** an attractive option for many, contributing to the decline of **printed materials**.

However, there are still compelling reasons why **printed newspapers and books** will continue to be relevant. Many people prefer the **tactile experience** of reading on paper, finding it more enjoyable and easier on the eyes compared to screens. Moreover, **printed materials** do not rely on **electronic devices** or **internet connectivity**, making them accessible in environments where **digital access** is limited. For instance, books are often cherished as collectibles and passed down through generations, preserving **cultural heritage**. Furthermore, certain **academic and professional fields** still rely heavily on **printed resources** for their **credibility and permanence**.

In conclusion, while **digital reading** will increasingly overshadow **printed newspapers and books** due to its **convenience and accessibility**, there will remain a **niche market** for **printed materials** driven by **personal preferences** and specific needs.

### Essay 3

!!! note "Question"
*Some people say that advertising is extremely successful at persuading us to buy things. Other people think that advertising is so common that we no longer pay attention to it. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.*

**Essay:**

**Advertising** plays a **pivotal role** in modern society, influencing **consumer behavior** and shaping **market trends**. While some believe that **advertising** is highly effective in persuading people to purchase products, others argue that its **omnipresence** has rendered it ineffective.

Supporters of **advertising’s persuasive power** highlight how **strategic campaigns** can significantly boost sales and **brand recognition**. For example, well-crafted **advertisements** for new smartphone models can create hype and drive **consumer interest**, leading to increased sales. Additionally, **advertisements** often appeal to **emotions and desires**, making products seem **indispensable**. **Celebrity endorsements** and attractive visuals further enhance the persuasive impact, convincing consumers to choose one brand over another.

Conversely, the **saturation of advertising** in everyday life has led to **consumer desensitization**. With **advertisements** appearing on every platform—television, social media, billboards—people have become adept at ignoring them. For instance, the use of **ad blockers** and skipping commercials reflect a growing trend of avoiding **advertising content**. Moreover, the **repetitive nature** of **ads** can cause annoyance, reducing their effectiveness and even fostering **negative perceptions** of brands. As a result, some believe that the sheer volume of **advertising** has diminished its ability to influence purchasing decisions.

In my opinion, while **advertising** remains a powerful tool for influencing **consumer behavior**, its effectiveness is waning due to **overexposure** and **consumer fatigue**. Therefore, advertisers must innovate and create more **engaging and targeted campaigns** to capture attention in a **crowded marketplace**.

### Essay 4

!!! note "*In some cultures, children are often told that they can achieve anything if they try hard enough. What are the advantages and disadvantages of giving children this message? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.*"

**Essay:**

Encouraging children by telling them they can achieve anything with enough effort is a common practice in many cultures. While this message can inspire and motivate, it also has potential drawbacks that need to be considered.

One significant advantage of this message is that it **fosters a strong work ethic** and **resilience** in children. Believing that hard work can **overcome obstacles** encourages **persistence** and **dedication**, essential traits for **personal and professional success**. For example, a child who is told they can excel academically if they study diligently is more likely to develop effective study habits and a **commitment to learning**. Additionally, this **positive reinforcement** can boost **self-esteem** and confidence, enabling children to take on challenges and pursue their goals with determination.

However, there are also disadvantages to this approach. Telling children they can achieve anything may set **unrealistic expectations**, leading to disappointment and frustration when they encounter failures. For instance, a child who is constantly told they can become a professional athlete might experience **significant stress and anxiety** if they do not possess the necessary talent or face injuries. Furthermore, this message can overlook the importance of **external factors** such as **socio-economic status**, **access to resources**, and **inherent abilities**, which play crucial roles in achieving success. Consequently, children might develop a **skewed perception of reality**, believing that effort alone is sufficient to **overcome all barriers**.

In my opinion, while encouraging children to strive for their goals is beneficial, it is equally important to teach them about the complexities and challenges they may face. **Balancing motivation with realistic expectations** can help children develop both ambition and **resilience**.

**注释：**
