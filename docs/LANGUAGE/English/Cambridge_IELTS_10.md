*#### 1. How do you usually spend your weekends? [Why?]*

Well, **it depends** on the circumstances. **If the weather permits**, I will go jogging or **hang out with friends**. In contrast, **if the weather is bad**, I prefer to stay indoors and read novels. I enjoy doing what I feel like doing and not being **restricted by errands**.

---

*#### 2. Which is your favorite part of the weekend? [Why?]*

I love Friday evenings when everyone is **laid back**, because the entire weekend is **waiting ahead**. On Friday evenings, I usually **eat out** with friends and then **stay up** for a movie or a TV show, knowing that I'll be able to **sleep in** the next morning.

---

*#### 3. Do you think your weekends are long enough? [Why/Why not?]*

No, I wish I had more spare time to **entertain myself** and **loosen up** after a whole week's **toil**. **If I had longer weekends**, I would be able to **exercise on a weekly basis**. I might **take up swimming and cycling** or **join the gym** to **work out**.

---

*#### 4. How important do you think it is to have free time at the weekends? [Why?]*

**It is absolutely essential**. First of all, I can spend some **quality time** with my family. In addition, a good weekend can help me **unwind mentally and physically**. I'm usually **more efficient and productive** in the following week if I've had enough **quality sleep** on the weekend. I guess it's probably because our brains need **rests** in order to **memorize and process** things better.

---

#### ***1. Which kinds of jobs have the highest salaries in your country? Why is this?***

**Sample Answer:**

Well, we often **picture rich people as business leaders, doctors, or lawyers**, because these occupations require more **professional knowledge**, **qualifications**, and **expertise**. However, the amount of **salaries** people receive for a certain job changes with the times. For example, when there is an **economic boom**, **financial advisors** and **stock brokers** may expect a **salary raise**.

---

#### ***2. Are there any other jobs that you think should have high salaries? Why do you think that?***

**Sample Answer:**

To be honest, I can’t think of any specific job right now, but I believe **salary has something to do with the responsibilities you take**. People who **shoulder more responsibilities** should receive **higher salaries**. For instance, if you are an **engineer in charge of the research and development** of a key product in the company, you should **receive far more money** than some of your co-workers.

#### ***3. Some people say it would be better for society if everyone got the same salary. What do you think about that? Why?***

**Sample Answer:**

I don’t think so. People are engaged in **different industries** and **contribute differently** to society. Even in a small company, each employee should receive a **salary commensurate with** their performance. Only in this way will the staff get **fair treatment** and become **highly motivated** to work **efficiently** and **happily**.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

There are three main **aisles** in the shop, and when you walk by the shelves, you'll find that all the goods are **categorised into** specific groups.

Last but not least, if you are not satisfied with a product you bought from the shopping malls, you can always **take it back** and **get a refund** as long as you keep the **receipt**.

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - People and Business

---

#### ***1. Why do some people want to start their own business?***

**Sample Answer:**

In my view, there are probably a number of factors involved. The chief cause might be that people are **motivated by** their dreams and want to do what they **like**. As well as this, people always believe that being **self-employed** means earning a lot of money, though in reality it is not that easy, especially for first-year **start-ups**. Additionally, there are people who become their own boss because they don't want to be controlled by others.

#### ***2. Are there any disadvantages to running a business? Which is the most serious?***

**Sample Answer:**

I am sure most people would agree that there are some negative aspects. I guess the most **adverse feature** would be that you have to **assume heavy responsibilities** and be **prepared for any possible risks**. For example, you need to sit down and think about all of the costs of doing and administering the business, making sure that it is profitable. Another trouble may be that you have to **work around the clock** and **burn the midnight oil** every day, unless you can find some really good employees whom you can trust while you are away.

---

Different people have **diversified needs** which should be **well-considered** and **taken care of**. Besides, a good business person also needs to be **visionary** and **down to earth** at the same time. Other qualities include being **conscientious**, **broad-minded**, **self-assured**, and **collaborative**.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **versatile** /ˈvɜːrsətl/: 多才多艺的

---

#### ***1. Do you enjoy travelling? [Why/Why not?]***

**Sample Answer:**

Well, **sort of**, I mean, **quantitatively** I've traveled a lot. I've been to more than 50 **domestic tour sites** so far, as well as a couple of foreign countries. But each time I was only able to stay for no more than a week. It was never enough.

The other place would be anywhere near the North Pole where I can see the mysterious **aurora**.

- ***And explain what you feel about this child.***

---

**Sample Answer:**

I'd like to talk about my **nephew**, who is **9 years old**. Actually, I don't get to see him often because he lives with his parents in another city, which is far away from my hometown. Every year, they come back to visit us during the **Spring Festival**.

Everyone in the family **adores** him because he is really **smart** and **talented**. His mother is a primary school teacher. She started to teach him to **recognize** pictures and to **distinguish** sounds only a few months after he was born. He was able to **mumble** short sentences after 15 months and was able to **recite** a few poems and solve some basic math problems at the age of 3. He went to school when he was only 5 and became a **school legend** ever since.

He enjoys **reading**, and he has a **wide range** of interests in reading, such as **biology**, **history**, **astrology**, **biography**, and so on. He also likes to watch **documentary films** about the same subjects, of course. Once, I asked him why he didn't go have fun during the Spring Festival because he was reading a history book. With the book in hand and his eyes still **glued to** the page, he said something that **struck me shockingly**, “I'm having fun right now.”

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Relationships Between Parents and Children

---

#### ***1. How much time do children spend with their parents in your country? Do you think that is enough?***

**Sample Answer:**

I would say, on **average**, children don't get to spend much time with their parents in China. This is mainly because young parents today are under great financial burden, so much so that in **most cases** they both have to do full-time jobs. And when they come back home, they would be too tired to spend much time with their kids. There are also many cases where parents have to work far from home to **bring food on the table** and to keep the family running. This explains why in most Chinese families, grandparents are taking care of the young generation.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **on average** /ɒn ˈævərɪdʒ/: 一般，平均来说
- **bring food on the table** /brɪŋ fuːd ɒn ðə ˈteɪbəl/: 养家糊口
- **most cases** /moʊst ˈkeɪsɪz/: 大部分情况下
- **grandparents** /ˈɡrændˌpɛrənts/: 祖父母

---

#### ***2. How important do you think spending time together is for the relationships between parents and children? Why?***

**Sample Answer:**

It is of **vital importance**, I think the key to developing close relationships between parents and children is **good communication**, which requires great time and effort to **establish**. To begin with, they need to spend a lot of time together to develop enough **intimacy** so that children would feel comfortable and relaxed when staying with parents. In addition, parents and children need to go through **difficulties** and **obstacles** together to build up trust among them. It's highly important for the children to know that whenever there is a problem, parents are the ones to turn to.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **vital importance** /ˈvaɪtl ɪmˈpɔːtəns/: 重要的，至关生死的
- **good communication** /ɡʊd kəˌmjuːnɪˈkeɪʃən/: 良好的沟通
- **establish** /ɪˈstæblɪʃ/: 建立，创办
- **intimacy** /ˈɪntɪməsi/: 亲密度
- **difficulties** /ˈdɪfɪkəltiz/: 困难
- **obstacles** /ˈɒbstəkəlz/: 障碍

---

#### ***3. Have relationships between parents and children changed in recent years? Why do you think that is?***

**Sample Answer:**

I can't help noticing that in many families, parents and children are sharing almost equal status in the family, which was very much unheard of decades ago. Parents are no longer playing dictators who would expect their children to act and behave exactly the way they want them to. They have learned to **respect** their children's own choices and only offer **advice** and **support** when needed. On the other hand, children are becoming less rebellious since there isn't much for them to fight against. I think what causes the change is **culture exchange**. In a **multi-cultural environment**, people are more likely to be **open-minded** and **tolerant**.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **share almost equal status** /ʃɛər ɔːlˈmoʊst ˈiːkwəl ˈsteɪtəs/: 共享几乎平等的地位
- **unheard of** /ʌnˈhɜːrd əv/: 前所未闻的

- **open-minded** /ˌoʊpənˈmaɪndɪd/: 心胸开阔的
- **tolerant** /ˈtɒlərənt/: 宽容的

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Children's Free-Time Activities

---

#### ***1. What are the most popular free-time activities with children today?***

**Sample Answer:**

Children today don't usually go out to play with other kids as I would when I was little, and toys seem to have lost their **charms** as well. They now prefer to spend their holidays **travelling**, watching **TV programmes**, or playing **online games**. In most cases, watching TV programmes and playing games are the popular choices, but when the holiday is long enough, children would beg their parents to take them on a trip. I think it's within children’s nature to be **curious** about the world, so it must be much more exciting to explore new places and make new friends than to stay at home facing the same people and doing the same things. **On top of that**, modern technology has made traveling much easier and more affordable for most families. At the age of 10, my nephew has already been to 17 countries in the world. I really wish that I were young again.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **charms** /tʃɑːmz/: 魅力，魔力
- **curious** /ˈkjʊəriəs/: 好奇的
- **prefer to** /prɪˈfɜːr tuː/: 宁愿

- **explore** /ɪkˈsplɔːr/: 探索
- **make new friends** /meɪk njuː frɛndz/: 交新朋友

---

#### ***2. Do you think the free-time activities children do today are good for their health? Why is that?***

**Sample Answer:**

I think it **depends** on what they do and how they do it. **Travelling** is definitely good for people's health. When you travel, chances are that you'll do a lot of **hiking**, you'll probably participate in a **variety** of outdoor activities, and you are likely to live a rather regular life due to the disconnection from the Internet and games. **On the other hand**, games can lead to serious health problems. Games are **addictive** in nature, to which children are **vulnerable**. Kids who are obsessed with online games are exposed to the potential danger of having **myopia**, **spinal curvature**, and **muscular atrophy**, because they sit for long hours with eyes **glued to** the screen.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **depends** /dɪˈpɛndz/: 取决于
- **travelling** /ˈtrævəlɪŋ/: 旅行
- **hiking** /ˈhaɪkɪŋ/: 徒步旅行
- **variety** /vəˈraɪəti/: 各种各样的

- **vulnerable** /ˈvʌlnərəbl/: 脆弱的，易受伤害的
- **myopia** /maɪˈəʊpiə/: 近视
- **spinal curvature** /ˈspaɪnl ˈkɜːrvətʃər/: 脊柱弯曲
- **muscular atrophy** /ˈmʌskjələr əˈtrəfi/: 肌肉萎缩
- **glued to** /ɡluːd tuː/: 粘住，盯住

---

#### ***3. How do you think children's activities will change in the future? Will this be a positive change?***

**Sample Answer:**

I think parents today have already **recognised** the **detriment** of children staying indoors too much. So in the future, I believe parents will spend more time with their children and they would **travel together**, go **hiking** and **camping together**, do some **sports together**, and spend more time **outdoors together**. This will definitely be a **positive influence** on children because it's good for children's health, as I mentioned before. More importantly, it could provide more opportunities for children and parents to **stay together as a family**, to **understand each other better**, and to **bond more tightly**, so that children can grow in a **healthier environment**.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **recognised** /ˈrɛkəɡnaɪzd/: 认出，识别，承认
- **detriment** /ˈdɛtrɪmənt/: 危害
- **travel together** /ˈtrævəl təˈɡɛðər/: 一起旅行

I remember I used to have to get up around six o'clock in the **morning** to catch the 6:30 bus. It was really a **torture** in winter. But I don't regret choosing it. After all, it was considered the **very best** high school in town.

---

**Sample Answer:**

Well, I can't actually **recall** anything I **dislike** about my school right now except that the school **playground** was too small. My high school was founded 70 years ago. It was big enough back then, when it only had to **accommodate** one tenth of the number of students today. There were only four **basketball courts**, so every day it was super **crowded**.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **buys** /baɪz/: 购买
- **builds** /bɪldz/: 建造

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 2 - Describe Something You Don't Have Now But Would Like to Own in the Future

---
    
***Describe something you don't have now but would like to own in the future.***

***You should say:***

- ***what this thing is***
- ***how long you have wanted to own it***
- ***where you first saw it***
- ***and explain why you would like to own it.***

---
    
**Sample Answer:**
    
Well, I found it really challenging to single out one item from the list of things I'd like to possess in the future. Most of the things I fantasized about are remotely unattainable, but if I have to choose one to talk about, it would be the **Bugatti Veyron super sports car**.

Actually, I've never had the opportunity to see one in **real life**. Everything I know about Bugatti is from either **magazines** or **documentary films**. I have been **obsessed** with cars since childhood. My father was a **locomotive driver** back then. He used to buy all kinds of books and magazines about **engines** and **automobiles**, and he loved to teach me to **recognize** and **appreciate** those **fancy cars**. Gradually, I became a big fan.

I love a **variety** of **world-class vehicles**, but **Bugatti Veyron** is one of a kind. With the **top speed** of 430 kilometers per hour, it's the **fastest mass-produced vehicle** on earth. Its **mighty W16 engine** can produce as much as 1200 **horsepower**, and the **uniquely designed automatic dual-clutch gearboxes** allow nearly no **power loss** during the **transmission**, which empowers the vehicle to **accelerate** from 0 to 100 km/h within only 2.5 seconds. But that's not the ultimate **facemelter**. At the speed of 100 km/h, this **iron beast** can be called to a full **halt** in just 2.2 seconds.

Bugatti is probably not one of the **best-looking** vehicles, nor is it the **most expensive** one, but it is the very **beauty** in my dream.

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Owning Things

---

#### ***1. What types of things do young people in your country most want to own today? Why is this?***

**Sample Answer:**

Well, it's hard to say. As a matter of fact, I don't even know what I want. However, I think in **general** there are a few things that people in China would like to add to their possessions. **On top of the list** is a **house**. It comes on top because, first of all, we all need a **roof to shelter**, and secondly, owning a house has become a **luxury** in China since the housing prices are ridiculously high today. Listed next to a house is a **private car**, the **fancier** the better. To young people, a car stands for much more than a means of **transportation**. It **functions** as a **name card** which **manifests** one's **economic status**, **social class**, **aesthetic taste**, and even **personalities**.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **general** /ˈdʒɛnərəl/: 一般的
- **on top of the list** /ɒn tɒp əv ðə lɪst/: 在列表的顶部
- **house** /haʊs/: 房子

- **aesthetic taste** /ɛsˈθɛtɪk teɪst/: 审美品味
- **personalities** /ˌpɜːrsəˈnælɪtiz/: 个性

---

#### ***2. Why do some people feel they need to own things?***

**Sample Answer:**

Personally, I believe that we all, **one way or another**, share the same kind of **feeling**. The **craving** for **possessions** is **hardwired** into people's brains since **primitive times** when people still had to struggle for **existence**. People had to **collect** everything they could get **in hand** to survive **floods**, **droughts**, **starvation**, **plagues**, **social turbulence**, **wars**, and so on. It gives people a sense of **security**, which is one of our basic emotional needs. Now that we are almost **free from** those worries, this powerful instinct still **governs** our **behavioral patterns** and **drives** us to **pursue** things that we don't actually need.

#### ***3. Do you think that owning lots of things gives people a sense of happiness? Why is that?***

**Sample Answer:**

Much as I find it hard to admit, I believe that **owning lots of things** does give people a sense of **happiness**. From the **scientific** point of view, happiness is simply the **bio-electric signal** perceived by our brain, which is caused by a **neurotransmitter** called **dopamine**. Recent studies have discovered that **collecting things** would increase the level of dopamine in the human brain. I know there are people saying something like, “I have a lot of money, but I don't feel happy." However, I think the problem is not about having a lot of money, but about missing something else such as **family**, **love**, **vacation**, and **recognition**. So such claims actually **prove** that we always want some more.

#### ***1. Do you think television and films can make people want to get new possessions? Why do they have this effect?***

**Sample Answer:**

Absolutely, such is **human nature** that the more we know, the more we want. **Television and films** constantly **feed** people with information about different **lifestyles**, new **technologies**, **fashion trends**, and **luxurious items**, creating an **ever-developing** concept of a "better life" to **catch up with**. What makes things worse are **TV commercials**. "They create false needs, sell false hopes, and make false promises."

If it were not for this powerful **drive**, we wouldn't have been able to **accumulate** enough **food** and **possessions** to support a **massive** population, without which the first human civilization wouldn't have **emerged**.

### Essay 1

**Question: **
*It is important for children to learn the difference between right and wrong at an early age. Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behaviour to children? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.*

**Essay: **

Teaching children the difference between **right and wrong** at an **early age** is crucial for their **moral development** and **social integration**. I strongly agree that **punishment** plays a necessary role in helping children understand this distinction, provided it is applied appropriately and constructively.

Firstly, **punishment** can serve as an effective tool for reinforcing **disciplinary boundaries**. When children engage in undesirable behavior, appropriate consequences help them recognize the **implications** of their actions. For example, if a child breaks a rule, a temporary loss of privileges can highlight the importance of adhering to established guidelines. This form of **constructive punishment** fosters a sense of **accountability** and encourages children to make better choices in the future.

Moreover, **punishment** when combined with **positive reinforcement**, can significantly enhance a child's understanding of **acceptable behavior**. **Consistent disciplinary measures** help children differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable actions, promoting **self-discipline** and **emotional regulation**. For instance, setting clear consequences for misbehavior alongside rewards for good behavior creates a balanced approach that supports overall **character building**.

However, it is essential that the **punishments** used are **age-appropriate** and **non-violent** to avoid causing **emotional harm** or **resentment**. **Parents and teachers** should employ **methods** such as time-outs, loss of privileges, or verbal reprimands rather than physical punishment. These **alternative disciplinary strategies** not only maintain the child's dignity but also encourage **reflective thinking** about their actions.

In conclusion, while punishment is necessary for teaching children the difference between right and wrong, it must be implemented thoughtfully and in conjunction with positive reinforcement. By using **constructive and age-appropriate punishments**, parents and teachers can effectively guide children towards **ethical and responsible behavior**.

### Essay 2

**Question: **
*Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they should only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.*

**Essay:**

The debate over whether university students should have the freedom to **study whatever they like** or focus solely on **useful subjects** such as **science and technology** is a contentious one. I believe that while allowing students to pursue their interests is important, a balanced approach that also considers future **employment prospects** is essential.

On one hand, allowing students to study subjects they are passionate about fosters **personal fulfillment** and **academic excellence**. When students are genuinely interested in their field of study, they are more likely to excel and contribute meaningfully to their chosen disciplines. For example, a student passionate about **literature** may produce outstanding research that enhances our understanding of cultural narratives. Moreover, diverse academic backgrounds enrich the **intellectual environment** of universities, promoting **innovative thinking** and **interdisciplinary collaboration**.

Conversely, proponents of focusing on **useful subjects** argue that higher education should be aligned with **market demands** to ensure students are equipped with skills that will lead to **employment opportunities**. In today’s rapidly evolving job market, expertise in **science and technology** is highly sought after, offering students better **career prospects** and **financial stability**. For instance, graduates with degrees in **computer science** or **engineering** often find themselves in high-demand fields with lucrative salaries. This pragmatic approach helps address the **skills gap** and supports economic growth by producing a workforce adept in **innovative technologies**.

However, it is crucial to recognize that not all students have the same interests or career aspirations. Imposing strict limitations on study choices can lead to **academic dissatisfaction** and reduce the **creativity** that stems from diverse fields of study. Therefore, universities should offer a **flexible curriculum** that allows students to combine their interests with subjects that enhance their **future employability**. For example, a student studying **art** could incorporate courses in **digital media** to broaden their career options in the growing field of **creative technologies**.

In conclusion, while focusing on **useful subjects** can enhance **employment prospects**, it is equally important to allow students the freedom to pursue their passions. A balanced approach that integrates both **personal interests** and **market-relevant skills** will lead to a more **innovative** and **satisfied** workforce, benefiting both individuals and society as a whole.

### Essay 3

**Question: **
*Countries are becoming more and more similar because people are able to buy the same products anywhere in the world. Do you think this is a positive or negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.*

**Essay:**

The increasing **globalization** has led to countries becoming more and more similar as people can purchase the same **products** anywhere in the world. I believe this development has both **positive** and **negative** implications, but the **advantages** outweigh the **disadvantages**.

On the positive side, the **availability of the same products** worldwide enhances **consumer convenience** and **economic efficiency**. Consumers can access a wide range of goods, ensuring that they can obtain high-quality products regardless of their location. For example, international brands like **Apple** and **Nike** are available in numerous countries, providing consumers with consistent quality and reliable service. Additionally, this similarity fosters **economic integration** as companies expand their operations globally, creating **job opportunities** and contributing to **economic growth** in various regions.

Moreover, the **exchange of goods and services** promotes **cultural exchange** and **mutual understanding** among different societies. When people use the same products, it creates a shared experience that can bridge **cultural gaps** and foster **international camaraderie**. For instance, the widespread use of **smartphones** has enabled people from diverse backgrounds to connect and communicate seamlessly, enhancing **global connectivity** and collaboration.

However, this trend also has its drawbacks. The **homogenization** of products can lead to the **erosion of local cultures** and **traditional practices**. As international brands dominate the market, local businesses may struggle to compete, resulting in the loss of **cultural diversity** and **unique regional identities**. For example, the prevalence of **fast food chains** like **McDonald's** can overshadow traditional cuisines, diminishing the richness of local culinary heritage.

Furthermore, the reliance on **global supply chains** can make countries vulnerable to **economic fluctuations** and **market dependencies**. Disruptions in one part of the world can have a cascading effect on others, leading to **economic instability** and **supply shortages**. The recent **pandemic** highlighted how interconnected economies are, as shutdowns in one region impacted product availability globally.

In conclusion, while the ability to buy the same products worldwide promotes **consumer convenience** and **economic growth**, it also poses threats to **cultural diversity** and **economic resilience**. Balancing **global integration** with the preservation of **local cultures** is essential to ensure that this development remains **beneficial** rather than **detrimental**.

### Essay 4

**Question: **
*Many museums charge for admission while others are free. Do you think the advantages of charging people for admission to museums outweigh the disadvantages? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.*

**Essay:**

The decision of whether museums should charge for admission or remain free is a topic of considerable debate. I believe that charging admission offers more **advantages** than **disadvantages**, primarily because it ensures **financial sustainability** and enhances the **quality of exhibits**.

One significant advantage of charging admission is that it provides museums with a reliable source of **funding**. This financial support is crucial for maintaining and **upgrading exhibits**, preserving **cultural artifacts**, and expanding educational programs. For example, renowned institutions like the **Louvre** and the **British Museum** charge admission fees, which contribute to their ability to host world-class exhibitions and conduct extensive **restoration projects**. Without these funds, museums might struggle to preserve their collections and offer engaging experiences to visitors.

Moreover, admission fees can help manage **visitor numbers**, preventing overcrowding and ensuring a more enjoyable and **educational** experience for guests. By providing a reliable and efficient alternative to road transport, trains can reduce the number of vehicles on highways, decreasing **commuting times** and enhancing **public transportation** systems. Cities like London and Paris have benefited from extensive rail networks that support their dense populations and bustling economies.

However, charging for admission may create a **barrier** for individuals from **low-income** backgrounds, limiting their access to **educational resources** and **cultural enrichment**. To mitigate this **disadvantage**, museums can offer **free entry days**, **discounted tickets** for students and seniors, or implement **membership programs** that provide benefits at a lower cost. For instance, many museums around the world have designated days where admission is free, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to experience and learn from their exhibits regardless of financial constraints.

In conclusion, while there are concerns about accessibility when museums charge for admission, the **financial benefits** and the ability to provide higher quality **exhibits** make it a worthwhile practice. By implementing measures to ensure affordability, museums can balance the need for **sustainable funding** with the goal of making **cultural education** accessible to all.
