---

#### ***1. What job would you like to have ten years from now? [Why?]***

**Sample Answer:**

Wow, that's a tough job interview question, let me think. Generally, I don't think that far into the future or worry about stuff. But I do hope I can become an **expert** of some sort in my field and probably **reach a more senior level** over time as I develop additional experience and expertise.

**Sample Answer:**

Immensely. I mean, as long as English is still the closest thing to the **lingua franca** of the world, I'll have to master this language in order to **communicate effectively** with people from other countries.

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 2 - Describe a Book That You Enjoyed Reading Because You Had to Think a Lot

---

***Describe a book that you enjoyed reading because you had to think a lot.***

***You should say:***

- ***what this book was***
- ***why you decided to read it***
- ***what reading this book made you think about***
- ***and explain why you enjoyed reading this book.***

---

**Sample Answer:**

The book I'd like to talk about topped many books on the year's list last year, and I finally got around to reading it recently. It's called **_Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup_**. I think the title pretty much sums up everything in the story—only it’s not a story, it's **nonfiction**.

First, I'll tell you about the startup that's at the center of the book—**Theranos**. This company, a combination of therapy and diagnosis, was founded by a brilliant young Stanford dropout, **Elizabeth Holmes**, who promised to revolutionize the medical industry with a machine that would take a small sample of a customer's blood and test for an overall picture of their health. For a while, she was seen as the female Steve Jobs, and her company was valued at up to **$9 billion**. But the only problem was, the technology never actually worked.

Now, unlike any other scam artist who would probably prey on gullible people at the bottom of the “food chain,” Elizabeth went straight for the people at the top. Experienced politicians, Wall Street tycoons, and even military personnel—all fell victim to her charm. The endorsement of these important people had, in turn, consolidated her status and credibility, which sustained the big lie until the very last minute.

This is the part that got me thinking the most. Although it remains a mystery what Elizabeth said to her investors behind closed doors because she refused to be interviewed by the author, a lesson can be learned: anyone, regardless of status and experience, can be fooled when their **ego** and **greed** are appealed to.

This book was such a **page turner** that I found myself unable to put it down once I started. The description of the secretive and toxic culture within the company especially **struck a chord** with me. I kept thinking, **what would I have done** if I had been one of the employees in the company? Would I **be brave enough to stand up** to this tyrannical leader?

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Owning Things

---

#### ***1. What types of things do young people in your country most want to own today? Why is this?***

**Sample Answer:**

Well, it seems that **picture books** are very popular these days, especially **English books** and **bilingual books**. A lot of Chinese parents are keen on making their children **bilingual** from an **early age**, and those books are considered essential. It has even become a business to compile lists of picture books for children, and you can search for the lists online and **buy all the books in one go**. Those often include **phonics readers**, **fairy tales**, and science **renderings**. Some of them are very fancy, with all kinds of added features like **maps**, **covers**, **pop-ups**, and so on.

---

#### ***2. What are the benefits of parents reading books to their children? Why is that?***

**Sample Answer:**

There are tons of obvious benefits, such as reading to children **enhances their vocabulary** and helps them understand different topics of the world. But there's much more. By **consistently reading** to your child every day, your child will learn to **concentrate** and **sit still for longer periods of time**, which can help them when they go to school. Another great benefit is reading **develops children's imagination and creativity**. When we really **engage in a book**, we imagine what the characters are doing and we visualize places we've never been to in real life. These are what make reading **stimulating** and **fun**. With all of the negative effects of **screen time**, choosing a book that **interests** your child and reading it together is definitely a better option. There's nothing better than **cuddling up** to your little one and reading a book or a **bedtime story** together.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **enhances their vocabulary** /ɪnˈhænsɪz ðɛər vəˈkæbjʊləri/: 提高他们的词汇量
- **consistently reading** /kənˈsɪstəntli ˈriːdɪŋ/: 持续阅读
- **concentrate** /ˈkɒnsənˌtreɪt/: 专注
- **sit still for longer periods of time** /sɪt stɪl fɔːr ˈlɒŋər ˈpɪəriədz əv taɪm/: 静坐更长时间
- **develops children's imagination and creativity** /dɪˈvɛləps ˈtʃɪldrənz ˌɪmædʒɪˈneɪʃən ənd kriːeɪˈtɪvɪti/: 培养儿童的想象力和创造力
- **engage in a book** /ɪnˈɡeɪdʒ ɪn ə bʊk/: 专注于一本书
- **stimulating** /ˈstɪmjʊleɪtɪŋ/: 令人兴奋的
- **cuddling up** /ˈkʌdlɪŋ ʌp/: 依偎
- **bedtime story** /ˈbɛdtaɪm ˈstɔːri/: 睡前故事

---

#### ***3. Should parents always let children choose the books they read? Why?***

**Sample Answer:**

Definitely! I mean, unless what they want to read is really not **age-appropriate**. But I strongly believe that generally, parents should **give children choices** when it comes to reading because it's the best way to **motivate** them to read. I know some parents may think some books are better than others, like **classic literature** is better than **comic books**, but I think they should actually celebrate that their kids are reading rather than playing video games all day. Besides, how are we to **determine** what are good and bad books for individual readers? If children have an amazing experience with books, they will almost certainly expand their interests into other types of writing in the future. On the contrary, **well-intentioned** adults can do a huge **disservice** to kids when they **deny** their ability to read or **censor** what they read and **judge** what they read.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **age-appropriate** /eɪdʒ əˈprəʊpriət/: 适合这个年龄的
- **give children choices** /ɡɪv ˈtʃɪldrən ˈʧɔɪsəz/: 给孩子选择的权利
- **motivate** /ˈməʊtɪveɪt/: 激励
- **classic literature** /ˈklæsɪk ˈlɪtərətʃər/: 经典文学
- **comic books** /ˈkɒmɪk bʊks/: 漫画书
- **determine** /dɪˈtɜːmɪn/: 决定
- **well-intentioned** /ˌwɛl ɪnˈtɛnʃənd/: 有好意的
- **disservice** /dɪsˈsɜːrvɪs/: 伤害，损害
- **deny** /dɪˈnaɪ/: 否认，拒绝
- **censor** /ˈsɛnsər/: 审查
- **judge** /dʒʌdʒ/: 判断

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Electronic Books

---

#### ***1. How popular are electronic books in your country? Why is this?***

**Sample Answer:**

Certainly more popular than five years ago, **electronic books** have become increasingly **affordable**, and there are now more books available **online**. I think it's fair to say that we now have an **enormous variety** of content accessible at any time of day, in any **format**, and through a range of **digital devices**. However, I reckon the **majority of readers** still prefer **print books** to digital products. I know many people who would **sample a few pages online** before buying a print version to read. But, of course, it all **depends on the person**. Some people enjoy the **feel of a physical book** in their hands, while others appreciate the **handiness** of an **e-reader**. As far as I know, there are still too many people who **don't read at all**!

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **electronic books** /ɪˌlɛktrɒˈnɪk bʊks/: 电子书
- **affordable** /əˈfɔːrdəbl/: 负担得起的

- **don't read at all** /doʊnt riːd æt ɔːl/: 完全不读书

---

#### ***2. What are the benefits of parents reading electronic books (compared to printed books)? Why do you think this is?***

**Sample Answer:**

Well, **portability** is probably the number one advantage of **electronic books**. You can have **quick and easy access** to hundreds of books on your device. While reading, you can also **click on hot links** to other resources to find out more about the topic **online**. This could really **come in handy** when you are reading a **science book** to your child. Additionally, if you are very **environmentally aware**, this could be a good opportunity to teach your children about **saving trees** and helping to **reduce pollution** from **pulp mills**.

- **reduce pollution** /rɪˈdjuːs pəˈluːʃən/: 减少污染
- **pulp mills** /pʌlp mɪlz/: 造纸厂

---

#### ***3. Will electronic books ever completely replace printed books in the future? Why?***

**Sample Answer:**

Well, some people think it's only a matter of time for **printed books** to disappear completely, but I'd hazard a guess that **physical books** are here to stay. I once read a very interesting argument that claimed **paper** was by far the best medium to **store information**. Printed books are **tough** and **hard to destroy**, compared to a **digital disk**, and they don't need any **energy to operate**. I think I'm quite **convinced** that there will always be a place for them. But this might all be because I have grown up reading **paper books** and find it harder to let them go. I guess younger generations who were **raised with screens** as very much a part of their lives would prefer a different world.

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 1 - Social Media

---

*In the first part of the IELTS Speaking test, the examiner will introduce themselves and confirm your identity. They will then ask you questions related to your studies, work, accommodation, or other familiar topics. Below are some example questions and sample answers on the topic of **Social Media**.*

---

#### ***1. Which social media websites do you use?***

**Sample Answer:**

Well, **WeChat** is obviously the top social network in China. It started out as an **instant messaging** app but soon expanded to a **go-to source** for social networking, entertainment, and even personal finance.

---

Definitely. There's something about social media that makes us **care** about how many friends, **followers**, **likes**, and **retweets** we have. We easily become obsessed with these numbers and are **unable to live in the moment**. For example, when you're on a trip, you're not enjoying it fully; you're just taking this opportunity to **snap a few pictures** to see how many **likes** and **comments** they'll get.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **care about** /kɛər əˈbaʊt/: 在乎
- **followers** /ˈfɑːloʊərz/: 关注者
- **likes** /laɪks/: 点赞

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 2 - Describe Something You Liked Very Much Which You Bought for Your Home

---

***Describe something you liked very much which you bought for your home.***

***You should say:***

- ***what you bought***
- ***when and where you bought it***
- ***why you chose this particular thing***
- ***and explain why you liked it so much.***

---

**Sample Answer:**

Since I'm not the breadwinner in my family, I don't get to decide on big purchases for my home like expensive furniture or appliances. However, I'd like to talk about a **robot vacuum** I bought that made my whole family very happy.

First, I'll tell you how it looks and how it works. Like most robot vacuums, it's **round and flat**, resembling a thick disk with **motorized brushes** at the bottom and a **vacuum motor** to collect dust and rubbish. It also has **sensors** for **evading obstacles** and **avoiding falls**. On top of that, it can automatically return to its **docking station** to **recharge** when its battery is low. It's fascinating to watch how it works **diligently around the house**. I still remember how my parents were **wide-eyed in amazement** when I first showed them the magic.

Ever since robot vacuums became popular, there have been a host of **models and brands** with all kinds of **fancy features**. Although the one I bought doesn't have all the **bells and whistles** of its competition, it's **no hassle to install**. What I love most is that it has a **lower profile**, allowing it to fit under more furniture. No more **bending over** to clean under the couch!

Another thing I like about this robot is that it is much **quieter** than a regular vacuum cleaner. After I **preset the vacuuming time**, I can just **sit back** and enjoy a clean room. I wouldn't say this vacuum has **delivered us from chores altogether**, since no robot vacuum is quite as **powerful** as a traditional vacuum and some **elbow grease**. However, it has been a huge help in keeping things **tidy between regular cleanings**. After six months of living with this new piece of technology, I **can't imagine living without it**. I should have bought it earlier! I think I would definitely **spring for a full-featured model** if the old one were to break down.

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Creating a Nice Home

---

#### ***1. Why do some people buy lots of things for their home?***

**Sample Answer:**

Well, your home is your **castle**, and I think people are **entitled** to buy whatever they see fit for their own home. But I guess we are all **prone to** buying more things than we need in this age of **advertising** and **social media**. Every advertisement carries the same message: your life will be better if you **buy** what they are selling. We begin to hear this message so many times and from so many angles that we start to **subtly believe** it. Meanwhile, social media further **encourages comparison**, and we usually end up buying stuff we don't need just because people in our **friendship circles** have done the same. Of course, sometimes there are good reasons for buying lots of things. For example, your home can quickly get **cluttered** after a baby comes along!

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **castle** /ˈkæsl/: 家是自己的城堡
- **entitled** /ɪnˈtaɪtld/: 有权利的
- **prone to** /proʊn tuː/: 倾向于

- **cluttered** /ˈklʌtərd/: 凌乱的

---

#### ***2. Do you think it is very expensive to make a home look nice? Why or why not?***

**Sample Answer:**

Not necessarily. If you **shop for secondhand furniture** and get **creative with decoration**, I think you can make your home look **stylish** on a **budget**. Also, the **devil is in the detail**, so another way to **spend your money wisely** is to buy small things that **attract attention**, for example, **eye-catching wall art** or **pillows**—they give the room a **polished look** without **setting you back** too much. And since the **minimalist movement** is all the rage right now, the simplest way to make your home look nice is to **declutter** it, though it's probably more expensive since you have to **throw all the things away**!

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **shop for secondhand furniture** /ʃɑːp fɔːr ˈsɛkəndˌhænd ˈfɜːrnɪʧər/: 购买二手家具

#### ***3. Why don't some people care about how their home looks? Why don't they care?***

**Sample Answer:**

This sounds a bit **condescending**, doesn't it? Maybe they do care but they just **cannot afford** the maintenance. Or maybe they are too busy. Some people don't care about **interior design** because they prefer to spend more time **outside**. **Home is where the heart is**; it doesn't have to be **beautiful** or **impressive**, as long as it is **functional** and **comfortable** and you **share it with people you love**, it is a good home. For one, I am not interested in **dusting knickknacks** that are supposed to make my home look "nicer."

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 3 - Different Types of Homes

---

#### ***1. In what ways is living in a flat/apartment better than living in a house?***

**Sample Answer:**

There are many advantages to living in a **flat** or an **apartment**, especially if you have just started a **graduate job** or have moved to a big city. The most obvious one is, of course, **costs**. Not only is the **rent** of an apartment usually cheaper than the **mortgage** of a house, but you will also have lower **living costs** such as **gas**, **water**, and **electricity** because the **square footage** is smaller. If you don't have a car, then the **location** of your property could be crucial. It's much easier to find an apartment in a **desirable city location**, whereas houses are usually built in the suburbs—you'll have to **endure the long commute** every day.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **flat** /flæt/: 公寓
- **apartment** /əˈpɑːrtmənt/: 公寓
- **graduate job** /ˈɡrædʒuət dʒɑːb/: 毕业后的第一份工作
- **costs** /kɒsts/: 成本
- **rent** /rɛnt/: 房租
- **mortgage** /ˈmɔːrɡɪdʒ/: 房屋抵押贷款
- **living costs** /ˈlɪvɪŋ kɒsts/: 生活开销
- **gas** /ɡæs/: 燃气
- **water** /ˈwɔːtər/: 水
- **electricity** /ɪlɛkˈtrɪsɪti/: 电
- **square footage** /skwɛər ˈfʊtɪdʒ/: 房屋面积

- **desirable city location** /dɪˈzaɪərəbl ˈsɪti loʊˈkeɪʃən/: 城市较好的位置
- **endure the long commute** /ɪnˈdjʊər ðə lɒŋ kəˈmjuːt/: 忍受长时间的通勤

#### ***2. Do you think homes will look different in the future? Why or why not?***

**Sample Answer:**

Well, in terms of **architecture** and **layout**, I'm not sure if there will be any **drastic changes** in how homes look in the next few decades. After all, the most **cutting-edge homes** today still have many of the same features that homes had fifty years ago. We still have **kitchens**, **living rooms**, **bedrooms**, and **bathrooms**. We're still sitting on **sofas**, **eating at tables**, and **sleeping on mattresses** on **bed frames**. However, if I have to predict what is going to change, it seems a given that most of our **electronics** and **appliances** will only get better, and they are bound to change how we live our lives at home. For example, a **smart home** with all the appliances **wirelessly connected** and **controlled by a single device** is no longer **science fiction**. If I'm around in fifty years, I definitely want my house to be more **efficient** and **green**.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **architecture** /ˈɑːrkɪtɛktʃər/: 建筑
- **layout** /ˈleɪaʊt/: 布局
- **drastic changes** /ˈdræstɪk ˈʧeɪnʤɪz/: 剧烈的变化

#### ***3. Do you agree that the kinds of homes people prefer change as they get older? Why or why not?***

**Sample Answer:**

Yes, I agree. We all have different needs for **accommodation** at different stages of our lives. While a young graduate may be happy to **share a flat** in the city center with a stranger, a **married couple with kids** will have to think about **space**, **privacy**, **neighborhood**, and so on. As people get older, they are also more likely to **own a property** rather than **rent one**. **Home ownership** gives the family a sense of **stability** and **security**. It's also viewed as a **hedge against inflation**. Obviously, when so many factors come into play, your **priorities** and **preferences** change.

- **accommodation** /əˌkɒməˈdeɪʃən/: 住所，住宿

### Essay 1

**Question: **

*Some people believe that it is best to accept a bad situation, such as an unsatisfactory job or shortage of money, while others argue that it is better to try and improve such situations. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.*

**Essay: **

Accepting a **bad situation**, such as an **unsatisfactory job** or **financial hardship**, is a viewpoint held by some who believe in **maintaining stability**. They argue that **enduring difficult circumstances** can **build resilience** and patience. For example, staying in a **challenging job** might provide long-term career benefits and **job security**. Additionally, **accepting financial shortages** without panic can lead to better **financial management** and savings. Thus, proponents believe that **perseverance** in the face of adversity fosters **personal growth**.

On the other hand, many advocate for **actively trying** to improve **unfavorable situations**. They contend that **taking initiative** can lead to better opportunities and enhanced well-being. For instance, **seeking a more fulfilling job** can increase **job satisfaction** and career advancement. Similarly, **addressing financial issues** through budgeting or additional income streams can alleviate stress and improve quality of life. Therefore, supporters believe that **proactive efforts** are essential for **overcoming challenges** and **achieving success**.

In my opinion, while **acceptance** can provide short-term stability, **striving to improve adverse situations** is more beneficial in the long run as it leads to **personal and professional development**.

### Essay 2

**Question: **

*Some people say that the main environmental problem of our time is the loss of particular species of plants and animals. Others say that there are more important environmental problems. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.*

**Essay:**

The **loss of specific plant and animal species** is often cited as the **foremost environmental issue** today. Advocates of this view emphasize that **biodiversity** is crucial for **ecosystem stability** and **overall planetary health**. For example, the extinction of **pollinators** like bees can disrupt **food production** and **agricultural economies**. Additionally, every species plays a unique role in its **habitat**, contributing to **natural processes** such as **decomposition** and **nutrient cycling**. Therefore, **preserving species diversity** is seen as essential for maintaining **ecological balance**.

Conversely, some argue that other **environmental problems**, such as **climate change** and **pollution**, are more pressing. They contend that these issues have **widespread and immediate impacts** on both natural and human systems. For instance, **rising global temperatures** can lead to **extreme weather events**, **sea-level rise**, and **habitat loss**, affecting millions of lives. Furthermore, **pollution of air and water sources** poses significant **health risks** to humans and wildlife alike. Proponents of this view believe that **addressing these broader issues** will inherently benefit **biodiversity** and **species preservation**.

In my opinion, while the **loss of species** is a critical concern, it is intertwined with larger **environmental challenges** like **climate change** and **pollution**. Therefore, **prioritizing comprehensive solutions** to these broader issues is necessary for effective **conservation of biodiversity**.

### Essay 3

**Question: **

*Some people say that music is a good way of bringing people of different cultures and ages together. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?*

**Essay:**

Music is often hailed as a **universal language** that can **bridge cultural and generational divides**. I strongly agree with the opinion that music serves as an effective medium for bringing people of different cultures and ages together, fostering **mutual understanding** and **harmony**.

Firstly, music **transcends language barriers**, allowing individuals from diverse backgrounds to **connect on an emotional level**. For example, a lively **samba rhythm** can unite people from various countries, enabling them to enjoy the same melody regardless of their native language. Additionally, **music events** such as concerts and festivals create spaces where people of all ages can come together, share experiences, and build lasting memories. This shared enjoyment **fosters a sense of community** and **belonging** among participants.

However, it is important to acknowledge that music alone may not entirely eliminate **cultural and generational differences**. While music can initiate interactions, deeper understanding requires more **comprehensive efforts**, including education and open dialogue. For instance, differing **musical tastes and preferences** can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or a lack of appreciation for each other's styles. Moreover, **generational gaps in music preferences** can create barriers in communication and mutual enjoyment. Therefore, while music is a powerful tool for connection, it should be complemented with other initiatives to fully bridge **cultural and age-related divides**.

In conclusion, music plays a significant role in uniting people from various cultures and age groups, but it should be part of a broader strategy to achieve complete **social integration**.

- **universal language** /ˌjuːnɪˈvɜːrsəl ˈlæŋɡwɪdʒ/: 通用语言

### Essay 4

**Question: **

*Nowadays many people choose to be self-employed, rather than to work for a company or organisation. Why might this be the case? What could be the disadvantages of being self-employed?*

**Essay:**

In today’s society, an increasing number of individuals are opting to become **self-employed** instead of working for **established companies** or organizations. This shift can be attributed to several factors, but it also comes with its own set of challenges.

One primary reason for the rise in **self-employment** is the desire for greater **flexibility and autonomy**. Many people seek the ability to set their own schedules and make independent decisions about their work. For example, **freelancers** in the **gig economy** enjoy the freedom to choose projects that align with their interests and skills, allowing for a more **personalized career path**. Additionally, advancements in technology have made it easier to start and manage a business from virtually anywhere, reducing the **barriers to entry** for **aspiring entrepreneurs**.

However, **self-employment** also presents significant disadvantages that can impact individuals negatively. One major drawback is the lack of **job security** and **stable income**. Unlike salaried positions, **self-employed** individuals often face **inconsistent earnings** and **financial uncertainty**, which can lead to stress and anxiety. For instance, **freelance graphic designers** may experience periods of high demand followed by times with few projects, making it difficult to plan financially. Furthermore, **self-employed** individuals are responsible for all aspects of their business, including marketing, administration, and **financial management**, which can be overwhelming and detract from their **core professional activities**.

In conclusion, while **self-employment** offers **flexibility and independence**, it also entails **financial instability** and increased **personal responsibility**, making it essential for individuals to weigh the pros and cons carefully before making the **transition**.

**注释：**

- **self-employed** /ˌsɛlf-ɪmˈplɔɪd/: 自雇的
- **established companies** /ɪˈstæblɪʃt ˈkʌmpəniz/: 已建立的公司
- **flexibility and autonomy** /flɛksɪˈbɪləti ænd ɔːˈtɒnəmi/: 灵活性和自主权
