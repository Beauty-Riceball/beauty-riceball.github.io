**Essay:**

Accepting a bad situation, such as an unsatisfactory job or financial hardship, is a viewpoint held by some who believe in maintaining stability. They argue that enduring difficult circumstances can build resilience and patience. For example, staying in a challenging job might provide long-term career benefits and job security. Additionally, accepting financial shortages without panic can lead to better financial management and savings. Thus, proponents believe that perseverance in the face of adversity fosters personal growth.

On the other hand, many advocate for actively trying to improve unfavorable situations. They contend that taking initiative can lead to better opportunities and enhanced well-being. For instance, seeking a more fulfilling job can increase job satisfaction and career advancement. Similarly, addressing financial issues through budgeting or additional income streams can alleviate stress and improve quality of life. Therefore, supporters believe that proactive efforts are essential for overcoming challenges and achieving success.

In my opinion, while acceptance can provide short-term stability, striving to improve adverse situations is more beneficial in the long run as it leads to personal and professional development.

### Essay 2

!!! note "Question"
*Some people say that the main environmental problem of our time is the loss of particular species of plants and animals. Others say that there are more important environmental problems. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.*

4. **结论**

**Essay:**

The loss of specific plant and animal species is often cited as the foremost environmental issue today. Advocates of this view emphasize that biodiversity is crucial for ecosystem stability and overall planetary health. For example, the extinction of pollinators like bees can disrupt food production and agricultural economies. Additionally, every species plays a unique role in its habitat, contributing to natural processes such as decomposition and nutrient cycling. Therefore, preserving species diversity is seen as essential for maintaining ecological balance.

Conversely, some argue that other environmental problems, such as climate change and pollution, are more pressing. They contend that these issues have widespread and immediate impacts on both natural and human systems. For instance, rising global temperatures can lead to extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and habitat loss, affecting millions of lives. Furthermore, pollution of air and water sources poses significant health risks to humans and wildlife alike. Proponents of this view believe that addressing these broader issues will inherently benefit biodiversity and species preservation.

In my opinion, while the loss of species is a critical concern, it is intertwined with larger environmental challenges like climate change and pollution. Therefore, prioritizing comprehensive solutions to these broader issues is necessary for effective conservation of biodiversity.

### Essay 3

*Some people say that music is a good way of bringing people of different cultures and ages together. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?*

   - 理由与例子
4. **结论**
   - 表达个人观点并总结

**Essay:**

Music is often hailed as a universal language that can bridge cultural and generational divides. I strongly agree with the opinion that music serves as an effective medium for bringing people of different cultures and ages together, fostering mutual understanding and harmony.

Firstly, music transcends language barriers, allowing individuals from diverse backgrounds to connect on an emotional level. For example, a lively samba rhythm can unite people from various countries, enabling them to enjoy the same melody regardless of their native language. Additionally, music events such as concerts and festivals create spaces where people of all ages can come together, share experiences, and build lasting memories. This shared enjoyment fosters a sense of community and belonging among participants.

However, it is important to acknowledge that music alone may not entirely eliminate cultural and generational differences. While music can initiate interactions, deeper understanding requires more comprehensive efforts, including education and open dialogue. For instance, differing musical tastes and preferences can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or a lack of appreciation for each other's styles. Moreover, generational gaps in music preferences can create barriers in communication and mutual enjoyment. Therefore, while music is a powerful tool for connection, it should be complemented with other initiatives to fully bridge cultural and age-related divides.

In conclusion, music plays a significant role in uniting people from various cultures and age groups, but it should be part of a broader strategy to achieve complete social integration.

### Essay 4

!!! note "Question"
*Nowadays many people choose to be self-employed, rather than to work for a company or organisation. Why might this be the case? What could be the disadvantages of being self-employed?*

4. **结论**
   - 总结主要论点或提出呼吁

**Essay:**

In today’s society, an increasing number of individuals are opting to become self-employed instead of working for established companies or organizations. This shift can be attributed to several factors, but it also comes with its own set of challenges.

One primary reason for the rise in self-employment is the desire for greater flexibility and autonomy. Many people seek the ability to set their own schedules and make independent decisions about their work. For example, freelancers in the gig economy enjoy the freedom to choose projects that align with their interests and skills, allowing for a more personalized career path. Additionally, advancements in technology have made it easier to start and manage a business from virtually anywhere, reducing the barriers to entry for aspiring entrepreneurs.

However, self-employment also presents significant disadvantages that can impact individuals negatively. One major drawback is the lack of job security and stable income. Unlike salaried positions, self-employed individuals often face inconsistent earnings and financial uncertainty, which can lead to stress and anxiety. For instance, freelance graphic designers may experience periods of high demand followed by times with few projects, making it difficult to plan financially. Furthermore, self-employed individuals are responsible for all aspects of their business, including marketing, administration, and financial management, which can be overwhelming and detract from their core professional activities.

In conclusion, while self-employment offers flexibility and independence, it also entails financial instability and increased personal responsibility, making it essential for individuals to weigh the pros and cons carefully before making the transition.
