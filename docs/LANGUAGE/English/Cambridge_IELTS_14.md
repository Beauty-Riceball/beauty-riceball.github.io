#### ***1. What job would you like to have ten years from now? [Why?]***

**Sample Answer:**

Wow, that's a tough job interview question, let me think. Generally, I don't think that far into the future or worry about stuff. But I do hope I can become an **expert** of some sort in my field and probably **reach a more senior level** over time as I develop additional experience and expertise.

Immensely.

### IELTS Speaking Preparation: Part 2 - Describe a Book That You Enjoyed Reading Because You Had to Think a Lot

---

***Describe a book that you enjoyed reading because you had to think a lot.***

***You should say:***

- ***what this book was***
- ***why you decided to read it***
- ***what reading this book made you think about***
- ***and explain why you enjoyed reading this book.***

---

**Sample Answer:**

The book I'd like to talk about topped many books on the year's list last year, and I finally got around to reading it recently. It's called **_Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup_**. I think the title pretty much sums up everything in the story—only it’s not a story, it's **nonfiction**.

First, I'll tell you about the startup that's at the center of the book—**Theranos**. This company, a combination of therapy and diagnosis, was founded by a brilliant young Stanford dropout, **Elizabeth Holmes**, who promised to revolutionize the medical industry with a machine that would take a small sample of a customer's blood and test for an overall picture of their health. For a while, she was seen as the female Steve Jobs, and her company was valued at up to **$9 billion**. But the only problem was, the technology never actually worked.

Now, unlike any other scam artist who would probably prey on gullible people at the bottom of the “food chain,” Elizabeth went straight for the people at the top. Experienced politicians, Wall Street tycoons, and even military personnel—all fell victim to her charm. The endorsement of these important people had, in turn, consolidated her status and credibility, which sustained the big lie until the very last minute.

This is the part that got me thinking the most. Although it remains a mystery what Elizabeth said to her investors behind closed doors because she refused to be interviewed by the author, a lesson can be learned: anyone, regardless of status and experience, can be fooled when their **ego** and **greed** are appealed to.

This book was such a **page turner** that I found myself unable to put it down once I started. The description of the secretive and toxic culture within the company especially **struck a chord** with me. I kept thinking, **what would I have done** if I had been one of the employees in the company? Would I **be brave enough to stand up** to this tyrannical leader?

#### ***1. What types of things do young people in your country most want to own today? Why is this?***

**Sample Answer:**

Well, it seems that **picture books** are very popular these days, especially **English books** and **bilingual books**. A lot of Chinese parents are keen on making their children **bilingual** from an **early age**, and those books are considered essential. It has even become a business to compile lists of picture books for children, and you can search for the lists online and **buy all the books in one go**.

---

#### ***2. What are the benefits of parents reading books to their children? Why is that?***

**Sample Answer:**

There are tons of obvious benefits, such as reading to children **enhances their vocabulary** and helps them understand different topics of the world. But there's much more. By **consistently reading** to your child every day, your child will learn to **concentrate** and **sit still for longer periods of time**, which can help them when they go to school. Another great benefit is reading **develops children's imagination and creativity**. When we really **engage in a book**, we imagine what the characters are doing and we visualize places we've never been to in real life. These are what make reading **stimulating** and **fun**. With all of the negative effects of **screen time**, choosing a book that **interests** your child and reading it together is definitely a better option. There's nothing better than **cuddling up** to your little one and reading a book or a **bedtime story** together.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **enhances their vocabulary** /ɪnˈhænsɪz ðɛər vəˈkæbjʊləri/: 提高他们的词汇量
- **consistently reading** /kənˈsɪstəntli ˈriːdɪŋ/: 持续阅读

- **engage in a book** /ɪnˈɡeɪdʒ ɪn ə bʊk/: 专注于一本书
- **stimulating** /ˈstɪmjʊleɪtɪŋ/: 令人兴奋的
- **cuddling up** /ˈkʌdlɪŋ ʌp/: 依偎
- **bedtime story** /ˈbɛdtaɪm ˈstɔːri/: 睡前故事

---

#### ***3. Should parents always let children choose the books they read? Why?***

**Sample Answer:**

Definitely! I mean, unless what they want to read is really not **age-appropriate**. But I strongly believe that generally, parents should **give children choices** when it comes to reading because it's the best way to **motivate** them to read. I know some parents may think some books are better than others, like **classic literature** is better than **comic books**, but I think they should actually celebrate that their kids are reading rather than playing video games all day. Besides, how are we to **determine** what are good and bad books for individual readers? If children have an amazing experience with books, they will almost certainly expand their interests into other types of writing in the future. On the contrary, **well-intentioned** adults can do a huge **disservice** to kids when they **deny** their ability to read or **censor** what they read and **judge** what they read.

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **age-appropriate** /eɪdʒ əˈprəʊpriət/: 适合这个年龄的
- **give children choices** /ɡɪv ˈtʃɪldrən ˈʧɔɪsəz/: 给孩子选择的权利
- **motivate** /ˈməʊtɪveɪt/: 激励

- **comic books** /ˈkɒmɪk bʊks/: 漫画书
- **determine** /dɪˈtɜːmɪn/: 决定
- **well-intentioned** /ˌwɛl ɪnˈtɛnʃənd/: 有好意的
- **disservice** /dɪsˈsɜːrvɪs/: 伤害，损害
- **deny** /dɪˈnaɪ/: 否认，拒绝
- **censor** /ˈsɛnsər/: 审查
- **judge** /dʒʌdʒ/: 判断

#### ***1. How popular are electronic books in your country? Why is this?***

**Sample Answer:**

I think it's fair to say that we now have an **enormous variety** of content accessible at any time of day, in any **format**, and through a range of **digital devices**. However, I reckon the **majority of readers** still prefer **print books** to digital products. I know many people who would **sample a few pages online** before buying a print version to read. But, of course, it all **depends on the person**. Some people enjoy the **feel of a physical book** in their hands, while others appreciate the **handiness** of an **e-reader**. As far as I know, there are still too many people who **don't read at all**!

**Advanced Vocabulary and Phrases:**

- **electronic books** /ɪˌlɛktrɒˈnɪk bʊks/: 电子书

#### ***2. What are the benefits of parents reading electronic books (compared to printed books)? Why do you think this is?***

**Sample Answer:**

Well, **portability** is probably the number one advantage of **electronic books**. You can have **quick and easy access** to hundreds of books on your device. While reading, you can also **click on hot links** to other resources to find out more about the topic **online**. This could really **come in handy** when you are reading a **science book** to your child. Additionally, if you are very **environmentally aware**, this could be a good opportunity to teach your children about **saving trees** and helping to **reduce pollution** from **pulp mills**.

---

#### ***3. Will electronic books ever completely replace printed books in the future? Why?***

**Sample Answer:**

Well, some people think it's only a matter of time for **printed books** to disappear completely, but I'd hazard a guess that **physical books** are here to stay. I once read a very interesting argument that claimed **paper** was by far the best medium to **store information**. Printed books are **tough** and **hard to destroy**, compared to a **digital disk**, and they don't need any **energy to operate**. I think I'm quite **convinced** that there will always be a place for them. But this might all be because I have grown up reading **paper books** and find it harder to let them go. I guess younger generations who were **raised with screens** as very much a part of their lives would prefer a different world.

### Essay 1

**Question: **

*Some people believe that it is best to accept a bad situation, such as an unsatisfactory job or shortage of money, while others argue that it is better to try and improve such situations. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.*

**Essay: **

Accepting a **bad situation**, such as an **unsatisfactory job** or **financial hardship**, is a viewpoint held by some who believe in **maintaining stability**. They argue that **enduring difficult circumstances** can **build resilience** and patience. For example, staying in a **challenging job** might provide long-term career benefits and **job security**. Additionally, **accepting financial shortages** without panic can lead to better **financial management** and savings. Thus, proponents believe that **perseverance** in the face of adversity fosters **personal growth**.

On the other hand, many advocate for **actively trying** to improve **unfavorable situations**. They contend that **taking initiative** can lead to better opportunities and enhanced well-being. For instance, **seeking a more fulfilling job** can increase **job satisfaction** and career advancement. Similarly, **addressing financial issues** through budgeting or additional income streams can alleviate stress and improve quality of life. Therefore, supporters believe that **proactive efforts** are essential for **overcoming challenges** and **achieving success**.

In my opinion, while **acceptance** can provide short-term stability, **striving to improve adverse situations** is more beneficial in the long run as it leads to **personal and professional development**.

### Essay 2

**Question: **

*Some people say that the main environmental problem of our time is the loss of particular species of plants and animals. Others say that there are more important environmental problems. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.*

**Essay:**

The **loss of specific plant and animal species** is often cited as the **foremost environmental issue** today. Advocates of this view emphasize that **biodiversity** is crucial for **ecosystem stability** and **overall planetary health**. For example, the extinction of **pollinators** like bees can disrupt **food production** and **agricultural economies**. Additionally, every species plays a unique role in its **habitat**, contributing to **natural processes** such as **decomposition** and **nutrient cycling**. Therefore, **preserving species diversity** is seen as essential for maintaining **ecological balance**.

Conversely, some argue that other **environmental problems**, such as **climate change** and **pollution**, are more pressing. They contend that these issues have **widespread and immediate impacts** on both natural and human systems. For instance, **rising global temperatures** can lead to **extreme weather events**, **sea-level rise**, and **habitat loss**, affecting millions of lives. Furthermore, **pollution of air and water sources** poses significant **health risks** to humans and wildlife alike. Proponents of this view believe that **addressing these broader issues** will inherently benefit **biodiversity** and **species preservation**.

In my opinion, while the **loss of species** is a critical concern, it is intertwined with larger **environmental challenges** like **climate change** and **pollution**. Therefore, **prioritizing comprehensive solutions** to these broader issues is necessary for effective **conservation of biodiversity**.

### Essay 3

**Question: **

*Some people say that music is a good way of bringing people of different cultures and ages together. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?*

**Essay:**

Music is often hailed as a **universal language** that can **bridge cultural and generational divides**. I strongly agree with the opinion that music serves as an effective medium for bringing people of different cultures and ages together, fostering **mutual understanding** and **harmony**.

Firstly, music **transcends language barriers**, allowing individuals from diverse backgrounds to **connect on an emotional level**. For example, a lively **samba rhythm** can unite people from various countries, enabling them to enjoy the same melody regardless of their native language. Additionally, **music events** such as concerts and festivals create spaces where people of all ages can come together, share experiences, and build lasting memories. This shared enjoyment **fosters a sense of community** and **belonging** among participants.

However, it is important to acknowledge that music alone may not entirely eliminate **cultural and generational differences**. While music can initiate interactions, deeper understanding requires more **comprehensive efforts**, including education and open dialogue. For instance, differing **musical tastes and preferences** can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or a lack of appreciation for each other's styles. Moreover, **generational gaps in music preferences** can create barriers in communication and mutual enjoyment. Therefore, while music is a powerful tool for connection, it should be complemented with other initiatives to fully bridge **cultural and age-related divides**.

In conclusion, music plays a significant role in uniting people from various cultures and age groups, but it should be part of a broader strategy to achieve complete **social integration**.

**注释：**

- **universal language** /ˌjuːnɪˈvɜːrsəl ˈlæŋɡwɪdʒ/: 通用语言

### Essay 4

**Question: **

*Nowadays many people choose to be self-employed, rather than to work for a company or organisation. Why might this be the case? What could be the disadvantages of being self-employed?*

**Essay:**

In today’s society, an increasing number of individuals are opting to become **self-employed** instead of working for **established companies** or organizations. This shift can be attributed to several factors, but it also comes with its own set of challenges.

One primary reason for the rise in **self-employment** is the desire for greater **flexibility and autonomy**. Many people seek the ability to set their own schedules and make independent decisions about their work. For example, **freelancers** in the **gig economy** enjoy the freedom to choose projects that align with their interests and skills, allowing for a more **personalized career path**. Additionally, advancements in technology have made it easier to start and manage a business from virtually anywhere, reducing the **barriers to entry** for **aspiring entrepreneurs**.

However, **self-employment** also presents significant disadvantages that can impact individuals negatively. One major drawback is the lack of **job security** and **stable income**. Unlike salaried positions, **self-employed** individuals often face **inconsistent earnings** and **financial uncertainty**, which can lead to stress and anxiety. For instance, **freelance graphic designers** may experience periods of high demand followed by times with few projects, making it difficult to plan financially. Furthermore, **self-employed** individuals are responsible for all aspects of their business, including marketing, administration, and **financial management**, which can be overwhelming and detract from their **core professional activities**.

In conclusion, while **self-employment** offers **flexibility and independence**, it also entails **financial instability** and increased **personal responsibility**, making it essential for individuals to weigh the pros and cons carefully before making the **transition**.

**注释：**

- **self-employed** /ˌsɛlf-ɪmˈplɔɪd/: 自雇的
- **established companies** /ɪˈstæblɪʃt ˈkʌmpəniz/: 已建立的公司
- **flexibility and autonomy** /flɛksɪˈbɪləti ænd ɔːˈtɒnəmi/: 灵活性和自主权
- **freelancers** /ˈfriːlənsəz/: 自由职业者
- **gig economy** /ɡɪɡ ɪˈkɒnəmi/: 零工经济
- **personalized career path** /ˌpɜːsənəlaɪzd kəˈrɪər pɑːθ/: 个性化的职业路径
- **barriers to entry** /ˈbærɪəz tə ˈɛntəri/: 进入壁垒
