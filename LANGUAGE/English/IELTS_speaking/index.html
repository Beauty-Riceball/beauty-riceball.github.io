<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>It <strong>depends</strong> on the situation. Most of the time, I don't <strong>laugh out loud</strong>; instead, I might just <strong>smile</strong> or <strong>chuckle</strong>. However, there are moments when something is so funny that it <strong>cracks me up</strong> completely.

Overall, I enjoy laughing and find it brings me a lot of <strong>joy</strong> and <strong>delight</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>

Fish is not only a healthy source of <strong>protein</strong>, but it can also be cooked in various ways.

<p>Yes, definitely! Making friends is a great way for me to <strong>juice up my life</strong> and learn about what others are doing. It allows me to <strong>see different lifestyles</strong> and broaden my <strong>social circle</strong>. If I didn't make an effort to meet new people, I would just stay in my <strong>comfort zone</strong>, which I find super boring.

<p>Just like the old saying goes, "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach him how to fish and you feed him for a lifetime." My favorite English teacher in college embodies this philosophy. She taught me many <strong>efficient and fun ways to learn English</strong> instead of just relying on rote memorization. Her teaching methods were <strong>inspiring</strong> and she always <strong>imparted wisdom</strong> that helped <strong>shape my young mind</strong>. Moreover, she created a <strong>positive learning environment</strong> where every student felt valued and encouraged to participate. Her guidance has had a lasting impact on my academic and personal growth.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>One of the things I dislike about teamwork is when someone isn't <strong>cooperative</strong>, which can slow everyone down.

<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, especially in big cities. You see a lot of people using <strong>bike-sharing services</strong> to get around, which is a great way to avoid traffic. In cities like Beijing, the main roads often have <strong>side lanes</strong> to make it easier for people to ride <strong>bicycles</strong> and <strong>electric scooters</strong>.

<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>I live in the <strong>city center</strong>, which is just a stone's throw away from the train station, so it doesn't have much <strong>natural scenery</strong>. However, it does offer a stunning <strong>cityscape</strong> at night, with marvelous <strong>skyscrapers</strong> lighting up the skyline. The area is a <strong>concrete jungle</strong>, bustling with <strong>hustle and bustle</strong> from people and traffic. Despite the lack of greenery, the <strong>serene</strong> and <strong>tranquil</strong> atmosphere in certain parts of the city provides a nice contrast to the busy streets. Overall, the view is a mix of modern architecture and vibrant urban life, making it both <strong>picturesque</strong> and lively.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>It <strong>depends</strong> on where you go. If we commute to work, <strong>subways</strong> are definitely the best choice since there's no <strong>traffic jam</strong> and there are stations directly to the CBD. However, if it's for traveling around China, the <strong>high-speed railway</strong> is the best option as it's fast and modern. Additionally, <strong>zebra crossings</strong> and dedicated <strong>pedestrian</strong> paths make walking and cycling safer and more convenient in urban areas, reducing the reliance on cars and alleviating <strong>traffic congestion</strong> during <strong>rush hours</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>I definitely prefer studying in a <strong>library</strong> over studying at home. My home is too <strong>cozy</strong>, and I often find myself getting <strong>distracted</strong> by various things or even <strong>falling asleep</strong>. In contrast, the library provides a more <strong>productive</strong> environment where I can <strong>eliminate distractions</strong> and <strong>immerse myself in the sea of knowledge</strong>. The quiet and structured setting of the library helps me focus better and complete my studies more efficiently without the tendency to <strong>procrastinate</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>I also prefer working in the <strong>workplace</strong> rather than at home. At home, the <strong>cozy</strong> atmosphere can be distracting, and it's easy to lose focus on work tasks. In the workplace, there are fewer distractions, and the environment is more <strong>professional</strong>, which helps me stay <strong>productive</strong> and motivated. Additionally, being in the workplace allows for better <strong>collaboration</strong> with colleagues and fosters a sense of <strong>team spirit</strong> that is hard to replicate at home.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Definitely not. Most people in China use <strong>electronic payments</strong> nowadays. <strong>Cash</strong> and <strong>coins</strong> are pretty much a thing of the past. I guess some <strong>senior citizens</strong> still carry coins, like my grandma, because she doesn't know how to use <strong>Alipay</strong> or <strong>WeChat Pay</strong>. With the rise of <strong>cashless</strong> transactions and <strong>contactless payments</strong>, there's less need to carry physical money. Additionally, <strong>coin jars</strong> and <strong>fareboxes</strong> in public transport systems have made it even more convenient to rely on electronic methods.</p>

<p>Yes, I like perfume as long as the <strong>scent</strong> isn't too strong. If it <strong>lingers</strong> too long, it gives me a headache.

<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>I'd like to share an exciting experience I had during a <strong>skiing trip</strong> with my university mates on a lads' holiday. This adventure took place a while back during the winter break when we were all seeking some excitement to fill our holidays. We decided to go skiing in <strong>Heilongjiang</strong>, which is renowned in China as the go-to place for winter fun.</p>
<p>The trip was not just thrilling but also a hilarious adventure. Picture this: a group of us, all trying to stay upright on those <strong>tricky slopes</strong> in Heilongjiang. Some of us were <strong>seasoned skiers</strong>, while others were like Bambi learning to walk! We tackled some pretty <strong>challenging runs</strong>, and it was an absolute riot watching my friends <strong>tumble</strong> and <strong>somersault</strong> in the snow. Of course, falling is all part of the skiing experience. We cheered them on, helped them up, and then it was back to tackling the slopes.</p>
<p>What made the trip truly exhilarating was the thrill of <strong>zooming down those mountains at breakneck speed</strong>, with the <strong>wind rushing past</strong> and <strong>adrenaline</strong> pumping through our veins. It was an absolute rush! We pushed ourselves to the limits, daring each other to go faster and take on more extreme runs. The occasional <strong>wipeout</strong> added to the fun—one minute you’re skiing smoothly, and the next, you're making snow angels! Despite the falls, the overall experience was incredibly enjoyable.</p>
<p>All in all, that skiing adventure with my university mates in Heilongjiang was a real blast. We had our fill of <strong>thrills</strong> on the slopes and strengthened our <strong>friendships</strong>. It's the kind of holiday memory that will put a smile on my face for years to come. I felt exhilarated, joyful, and grateful for the unforgettable time we shared together.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>I'd like to describe a beautiful city in China called <strong>Hangzhou</strong>. I first heard about it from some friends who went there and couldn't stop raving about its beauty. Then, I saw some stunning pictures of the place on <strong>social media</strong> and knew I had to check it out for myself.</p>
<p>I finally made my way to Hangzhou in the fall of 2022. It was the perfect time to go because the city looks absolutely magical during that season. The main reason for my visit was the famous <strong>West Lake</strong>. This place is like something out of a fairy tale—imagine serene lakes, charming islands, old bridges, and traditional gardens all in one spot. I just had to see it in person.</p>
<p>Hangzhou has some impressive buildings too. The one that stands out most is the <strong>Leifeng Tower</strong>; it's an ancient Buddhist tower with a really long history. People say it's one of the symbols of Hangzhou. When it comes to gardens and courtyards, Hangzhou has some real gems, like the <strong>Yue Temple</strong> and the <strong>Botanical Garden</strong>. These places are like art in the form of gardens.</p>
<p>But what makes Hangzhou truly famous is its breathtaking natural scenery, its rich culture, and its unique history. <strong>West Lake</strong> alone is enough to make it a top destination. It's famous not just because of the beauty, but also for the whole vibe—the tea culture and the delicious local food like <strong>Longjing tea</strong> and Hangzhou dishes. It's a city that's got it all, and I can't wait to go back someday.</p>

<p>I recently came across an <strong>advertisement</strong> that I found not only informative but also incredibly useful. I encountered this ad while <strong>browsing the internet</strong> on my PC, and it addressed an issue I was facing with my home internet connection.</p>
<p>The advertisement focused on <strong>broadband services</strong>, specifically highlighting the benefits of <strong>fiber optic connections</strong>. It emphasized how providers offering fiber optic connections could deliver exceptionally fast <strong>internet speeds</strong>, making it ideal for activities like <strong>online gaming</strong>. This immediately caught my <strong>attention</strong> because I am an avid gamer, and I had been struggling with internet outages during crucial gaming moments. My home had been using a previous internet service provider whose unreliable service often cut out, especially during peak usage times.</p>
<p>What made this advertisement particularly useful was that it didn't directly promote a specific product or company. Instead, it <strong>educated viewers</strong> about the technology itself. It explained the impact of old copper wiring on internet speed and how upgrading to <strong>fiber optic cables</strong> could significantly <strong>enhance</strong> the internet experience. This newfound knowledge was eye-opening for me, as I had never considered that the physical infrastructure might be the root cause of my internet problems.</p>
<p>Armed with this information, I decided to take action. I contacted the company mentioned in the ad and switched to their broadband service that offered fiber optic connectivity. The results were astounding. My internet is now incredibly fast and stable, especially for gaming. I couldn't be happier with the switch. The advertisement played a pivotal role in my <strong>decision-making process</strong>, and I believe it could help others who might be facing similar issues.</p>
<p>This advertisement was not just useful but also <strong>empowering</strong>. It provided <strong>valuable information</strong>, leading to a <strong>tangible improvement</strong> in my internet experience. I feel grateful for coming across it, as it significantly enhanced my daily life and gaming sessions.</p>

<p>I'd like to talk about a famous athlete I greatly admire, <strong>LeBron James</strong>. He is an iconic basketball player known for his impressive height of about 6 feet 9 inches, incredible strength, and a remarkable vertical jump. LeBron is a superstar in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and has achieved numerous accolades, including being a four-time NBA champion and a four-time Most Valuable Player (MVP). Apart from his basketball success, he's also known for his wonderful family.</p>
<p>I became familiar with LeBron James when I was a child. My dad was an avid NBA fan, and he used to watch NBA games regularly. His enthusiasm for the sport rubbed off on me, and I began to take an interest in basketball too. At first, I didn’t have a favorite player since the famous ones were already popular, and I wanted someone unique. That's when I started noticing LeBron James. LeBron had a somewhat polarizing reputation when he first entered the league, but what truly stood out to me was his unwavering determination to chase his dreams. I admire him for his courage and resilience in the face of adversity. He's not just an exceptional player but also an incredible leader and facilitator on the court. He consistently motivates and uplifts his teammates, which contributes to his team's success. In addition, he is such a role model in real life as he has donated millions towards charity and even sponsored a whole school by himself for children who want to go to school but don't have the chance to.</p>
<p>In summary, LeBron James is a successful athlete I admire greatly. His remarkable basketball career, including multiple championships and MVP awards, is just one facet of his fame. What makes him truly exceptional is his courage, leadership, and ability to inspire both on and off the basketball court.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>I'd like to describe a bad service experience I had in a restaurant about six months ago. My friends and I had our usual <strong>get-together</strong>, and normally, we would hit up a restaurant we liked near our university dorm. But this time, someone decided to change things up.</p>
<p>On that day, we met up and started with some bubble tea. As we were sipping our drinks, one of us found a new restaurant online and thought, "Why not give it a try?" When we got there, it was packed. Even though we had a <strong>reservation</strong>, they sat us at a tiny table and then our waiter just <strong>vanished</strong>. It took forever for the food to arrive, and the service was extremely slow. We were <strong>twiddling our thumbs</strong>, waiting for a whole hour without any sign of our meals. We were getting seriously hungry and <strong>frustrated</strong>, so I decided it was time to take action. I tracked down the <strong>manager</strong> and laid out the whole story, emphasizing how crazy slow the service had been. To my surprise, the manager was super <strong>understanding</strong> and <strong>sorry</strong> about the whole thing. To make up for it, he not only ensured our food came out quickly but also told us that our whole dinner was on the house.</p>
<p>Looking back on it, I learned that you need to speak up when dealing with bad service. While the initial frustration put a damper on the evening, the manager's effective action turned things around. So, even though we were a bit <strong>annoyed</strong> at first, we left the place feeling better about it, thanks to the manager stepping up.</p>

<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>One of the important <strong>rules</strong> in my workplace concerns <strong>punctuality</strong>. It's a straightforward rule but plays a crucial role in maintaining a <strong>productive</strong> and <strong>organized</strong> work environment. This rule is about arriving at work on time and adhering to the <strong>scheduled work hours</strong>. At my workplace, we have fixed working hours, and employees are expected to be at their desks or workstations promptly at the <strong>designated start time</strong>. <strong>Punctuality</strong> also applies to <strong>meetings</strong>, <strong>deadlines</strong>, and other work-related <strong>commitments</strong>.</p>
<p>When people break this rule, there are <strong>consequences</strong>. Initially, it might result in verbal warnings or <strong>counseling</strong> if there are valid reasons for the lateness. Repeated violations can lead to more severe consequences, including written warnings or, in extreme cases, <strong>termination</strong> of employment. I believe this rule is critically important for several reasons.</p>
<p>First and foremost, it demonstrates <strong>professionalism</strong> and <strong>respect</strong> for one's <strong>colleagues</strong> and <strong>superiors</strong>. Being punctual shows that you value your time and that of others. It contributes to a <strong>harmonious work environment</strong> where everyone can rely on each other to fulfill their duties promptly. <strong>Punctuality</strong> is also essential for maintaining <strong>productivity</strong> and meeting <strong>deadlines</strong>.</p>
<p>Personally, I strongly support and adhere to this rule. It instills <strong>discipline</strong> and a sense of <strong>responsibility</strong>. When everyone follows this rule, it fosters a positive <strong>work culture</strong> where people can <strong>trust</strong> each other to be <strong>reliable</strong> and <strong>efficient</strong>. Overall, <strong>punctuality</strong> is a simple yet vital rule that contributes to a well-functioning and respectful work environment, and I believe it should be upheld and respected by everyone.</p>

<li><strong>What rules should children follow at home in your country?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>In China, there are certain rules that children are often encouraged to follow at home. <strong>Respect for elders</strong> is a fundamental one, which involves addressing elders with appropriate titles and showing deference to their opinions. <strong>Studying diligently</strong> and excelling in education is highly emphasized, reflecting the importance placed on academic achievement. Additionally, <strong>cleanliness and tidiness</strong> are important, so children are encouraged to keep their living spaces organized. Finally, traditional values like <strong>filial piety</strong>, where children show deep respect and care for their parents, are instilled from a young age.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>On what occasions can children be forgiven if they don't follow some rules?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Children can be forgiven for not following some rules on occasions like important holidays or family celebrations, such as Chinese New Year. During these times, there's often a more relaxed atmosphere, and the focus is on togetherness and joy. It's also understood that children may be more excitable or distracted during these events. However, it's essential to strike a balance between forgiveness and maintaining respect and decorum, especially in public or formal settings.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What rules should people follow when using public transport?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Using public transport comes with many rules that people should follow. Firstly, it's crucial to <strong>queue up</strong> and <strong>wait your turn</strong> when boarding buses or trains. Cutting in lines is generally considered impolite and can lead to conflicts. <strong>Seats designated</strong> for the elderly, disabled, or pregnant passengers should be given up to those who need them. <strong>Loud conversations</strong> or playing music without headphones should be avoided as they can disturb fellow passengers. Additionally, <strong>littering</strong> and <strong>vandalism</strong> on public transport are unacceptable and can result in fines. Overall, it's about being considerate and maintaining a pleasant travel experience for everyone.</p>

<p>In my view, having some level of strict rules in school is necessary. These rules create a structured and safe learning environment. They help maintain discipline and ensure that students can focus on their studies without disruption. However, it's essential to strike a balance. Rules should not be excessively strict to the point of stifling individuality or creativity. A balanced approach ensures that students learn discipline while also being able to express themselves and develop their unique talents.</p>

<li><strong>What kind of exercise do Chinese people like to do?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>I would certainly say that <strong>table tennis</strong> is really popular in China. The equipment is really easy to carry around, all you need are two bats and a ball, which is very minimal. On top of that, the sport does not involve a lot of body contact, unlike basketball. So, most of the Chinese people would like to play table tennis. Additionally, other non-body contact sports like <strong>badminton</strong> are generally praised by the public. Lastly, <strong>basketball</strong> is one of the favorite sports in China, enjoyed by many across different age groups.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What characteristics do you think an athlete should have?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Well, when it comes to the characteristics that athletes should have, there's quite a few. First and foremost, <strong>discipline</strong> is crucial. Athletes need to stick to rigorous training regimens, stay committed to their sport, and push through challenges. <strong>Dedication</strong> is another key trait; they must be wholeheartedly invested in their craft. <strong>Perseverance</strong> is a big one because setbacks are part of the game, and athletes need to keep going. <strong>Mental resilience</strong> is vital for handling the pressure that often comes with competition. Of course, you can't forget about the physical aspects. Athletes need to be in peak physical condition, so fitness and agility are a must. And let's not overlook <strong>teamwork</strong> and <strong>communication</strong>, which are essential for team sports.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do you think PE classes should be replaced by academic classes?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>No, I don't think <strong>Physical Education (PE)</strong> classes should be replaced by academic classes. Teamwork and education include both academic and physical development because they complement each other. Physical activity can actually enhance academic performance by improving focus and reducing stress. Therefore, the two should go hand in hand to ensure students receive a holistic education that prepares them for success in all aspects of life.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Is talent important in sports?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely, talent plays a crucial role in sports. I think talent serves as the foundation upon which athletes build their skills. Natural abilities like speed, coordination, and strength can provide a significant advantage. I think talent determines how high you can reach as an athlete. However, talent alone isn't sufficient for success. <strong>Discipline</strong>, <strong>hard work</strong>, and a strong work ethic are equally vital. Many world-class athletes have reached their pinnacle not solely due to talent but through relentless training and dedication. Talent might open doors, but sustained success in sports demands relentless effort and unwavering commitment to improvement.</p>

<li><strong>How do most people respond to bad services?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Well, in my opinion, most people tend to respond to bad services with a mix of frustration and disappointment. However, it might also depend on their personality. I have seen some people overreact as they might express their dissatisfaction by complaining directly to the service provider, writing negative reviews, or seeking refunds, and some choose to escalate the issue to management or regulatory authorities. I have also seen some people choose not to say anything and just note down that they may never come to that restaurant again. Ultimately, the response varies depending on the severity of the problem and the individual's personality.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do you think services are better now than in the past?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>In many ways, yes, services have improved over time thanks to advancements in technology and increased competition, which have raised the bar for service quality in various industries. Today, some services often have more choices, better convenience, and faster responses. Where one place does something, another place may copy, bringing more new ideas and ways to attract customers. However, the perception of service quality can be subjective and varies from person to person. Some customers may prefer certain ways of service, while others might want to keep it simple.</p>

<li><strong>What kinds of services are bad service?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Bad services can take many forms. They can include poor customer support, delayed deliveries, subpar product quality, or unmeasured services. Any service that falls short of customer expectations or violates agreed-upon standards can be considered bad service. However, again, some customers just have certain expectations naturally, so it varies depending on the person's expectations.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why do some people choose to remain silent when they receive bad services?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Well, I think there are several reasons why some people remain silent about bad services. They might fear confrontation, thinking that they would rather not make a scene than complain directly and possibly never come back to the place. Others might believe that it's not worth their time and effort, or worry about potential repercussions. The rest might not be aware of their rights as consumers or feel resigned to accept poor service as normal. In some cases, it's about personal temperament; not everyone is inclined to complain openly when they encounter problems.</p>

<p>When I saw this topic, the first place that popped up in my mind is a park.
To tell you more about it, this park is a popular destination in my community, which is just a stone's throw away from my home.
So one afternoon, during one summer vacation, while my friends and I were discussing where to recharge and unwind after final exams, I suggested having a picnic party together in this park.
After that, we usually go there.</p>
<p>2-WHAT</p>
<p>Speaking of what it is like and what you often do there, well, I wanna share with you.
Talking about the scenery of the park, it's second to none. In fact, it's like a paradise for all my friends to enjoy the serene and picturesque view. When we go there, we enjoy the lush greenery and vibrant flowers along the peaceful walking paths.
In terms of the leisure activities in the park, they're also beyond compare. As a matter of fact, there's a large lawn for people to sit, lie down and have a picnic, and it's a particularly popular activity among the younger generation, including us. When we are there, we prepare food and chat about our lives on the lawn.</p>

<p>2-WHAT</p>
<p>Speaking of what it is like, well,
Talking about the scenery from the window, it's second to none. In fact, her home is located in a great neighbourhood, which is just a stone's throw away from the city centre.
Therefore, we can see a spectacular view of the city from the large French window of the living room.
In terms of what I can do in it, my friends and I usually curl up on her cozy sofa, watching our favourite reality show, while eating fruits and snacks. Meanwhile, we often chat about our days at work or school, or play card games to recharge and unwind.</p>

<p><strong>SAMPLE5:</strong></p>
<p>1-INTRO</p>
<p>When I saw this topic, the first experience that popped up in my mind is attending a debate competition.
To tell you more about it, this competition is quite a popular annual event at our university that attracts almost everyone to gather and watch it each year.
However, I was extremely nervous about this competition when I was preparing for it because
I'm not very confident in giving a speech.
Whenever I thought of the possibility of failing it, I felt a bit down in the dumps.</p>
<p>2-WHAT</p>
<p>Speaking of why you thought it was a difficult challenge, well,
On the first few days, we found it difficult to write a perfect draft because we were completely lost and didn't know where to begin. As a result, we started procrastinating and felt blue.
But as they say, "There's light at the end of the tunnel." A day later, I discussed with my teammates and we gave each other tons of tips and guidance. We made a detailed plan that could break this task into many small and doable steps, which could help us finish the draft more efficiently and with better quality.
Later on, we began to make progress and finished our speech draft in just two days.
Finally, we were over the moon to find out we got the third place for the competition.</p>
<p>3-WHY/HOW</p>
<p>When it comes to how I felt at the time, well,
I have mixed feelings about it as it was both a challenging but inspiring process. It was such a challenge because I almost didn't make it, while it was truly inspiring to witness myself overcome obstacles and become a better version of myself along the way.
To conclude, this experience is deeply rooted in my mind and will be cherished by me forever. It always puts a smile on my face whenever I think of it.</p>

<p><strong>SAMPLE6:</strong></p>
<p>1-INTRO</p>
<p>When I saw this topic, the first occasion that popped up in my mind was helping my 20-year-old cousin, Olivia, decide to apply to the computer science programme at her dream university.
To tell you more about it, it happened last winter, when the Spring Festival was just around the corner, when I was visiting my aunt's, you know, Olivia's mum's place. Olivia asked me if I could help her because she knew I have a knack for coding and I'm working as an AI engineer.
In fact, she's always been interested in the theory and usage of coding. Unfortunately, the things she learned in school have nothing to do with computer science or mathematics. Because of that, she wasn't sure she could pull it off so she asked me for advice.</p>
<p>2-WHAT</p>
<p>Speaking of how I helped, well,
First, I told her what studying computer science at university is like, including the courses she would take and how challenging the exams can be. This gave her a basic understanding of the major and a clear picture of what to expect in the near future.
I also talked about career prospects, for example, I shared what my work life is like, including my schedule and salary. I was hoping to show her that this is a promising career path that's worth pursuing.
Finally, I encouraged her to believe in herself. I helped her see that no matter what major she chooses, she'll succeed because she's both smart and hardworking.</p>
<p>3-WHY/HOW</p>
<p>When it comes to how I felt about the experience, well,
A few months later, she told me she had made up her mind in the end and was admitted to her dream school. To be honest, I was over the moon and even burst into tears when I first heard the news. On top of that, it was such an honor when she asked me to accompany her to the college's opening ceremony.
To conclude, this experience is deeply rooted in my mind and I will cherish this memory forever.
In the future, whenever I think of it, it will always put a smile on my face.</p>
